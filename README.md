# Welcome!
This is an expansion for DND 5E that adds in (nearly) everything from Wharhammer 40K including classes, races, enimies, weapons, and more!
The original creator of this expansion is no longer supporting it, so i decided to make a GitHub Repository so that people can still access it and make changes.

the original is linked below:

it contains a few folders, each one containing google documents where each one is a chapter of the book.
