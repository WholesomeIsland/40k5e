# Chapter 1: Step-by-Step Characters

## Building Krieg the Krieger

Each step of character creation includes an example of that step, with a player named
Bob building his human character, Krieg the Krieger.

## 1. Choose a Race

Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the
_Warhammer 40k_ universe. The most common player character races are humans, eldar,
tau, and orks. Some races also have subraces, such as craftworld eldar or ork weirdboys.
The Races section provides more information about these races.

The race you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an important way, by
establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and
ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular racial traits, such as special senses,
proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability
to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain
classes (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of lightfoot ratlings make them
exceptional rogues, and sage eldar tend to be powerful psykers. Sometimes playing
against type can be fun, too. Ratling paragons and Tau barbarians, for example, can be
unusual but memorable characters.

Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step

3. Note these increases and remember to apply them later.

Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be sure to note your
starting languages and your base speed as well.

**BUILDING KRIEG THE KRIEGER, STEP 1**
Bob is sitting down to create his character. He decides that a gruff human fits the
character he wants to play. He notes all the racial traits of humans on his character
sheet, including his speed of 30 feet and the languages he knows: Low Gothic and one
other of his choice. He chooses Imperial Codes as his second language after looking in
Chapter 4: Background at the list of languages.

## 2. Choose a Class


Every character is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character’s vocation,
what special talents he, she, or it possesses, and the tactics he, she, or it is most likely to
employ when exploring an ancient ruin, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense
negotiation. The character classes are described in the Classes section.

Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these
benefits are class features — capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character
apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of proficiencies: armor,
weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of
the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling
a convincing lie.

On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level.

#### Level

Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by exploring, fighting,
solving dilemmas, and gaining experience points (XP). A 1st-level character is
inexperienced in the world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a pirate and
done dangerous things before.

Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life. If you’re
already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&D campaign, your DM
might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the assumption that your character
has already survived a few harrowing adventures.

Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re starting at a higher level, record the
additional elements your class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also record your
experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XP. A higher-level character typically
begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see “Beyond 1st
Level” later in this section).

#### Hit Points and Hit Dice

Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other
dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit
Point Dice).

At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class.
You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class
description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.)


This is also your hit point maximum.

Record your character’s hit points on your character sheet. Also record the type of Hit
Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can
spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see “Resting” in the Adventuring section).

#### Proficiency Bonus

The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +
2 for a 1st-level character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll
be recording on your character sheet:

```
⦁ Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with
⦁ Attack rolls with spells you cast
⦁ Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in
⦁ Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with
⦁ Saving throws you’re proficient in
⦁ Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)
```
Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and
some of your skill and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in "Using Ability Scores",
tools in "Equipment.") Your background gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies,
and some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as
well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than
once. Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for
example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus
applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once,
you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.

**BUILDING KRIEG THE KRIEGER, STEP 2**
Bob imagines Krieg the Krieger charging into battle with a shovel, covered in the blood
of his enemies. He makes Krieg a fighter and notes the fighter’s proficiencies and 1st-
level class features on his character sheet.

As a 1st-level fighter, Krieg has 1 Hit Die—a d10—and starts with hit points equal to 10 +
his Constitution modifier. Bob notes this, and will record the final number after he
determines Krieg’s Constitution score (see step 3). Bob also notes the proficiency bonus
for a 1st-level character, which is +2.


## 3. Determine Ability Scores

Much of what your character does in the game depends on his, her, or its six abilities:
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each ability has a
score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.

The six abilities and their use in the game are described in the Using Ability Scores
section. The Ability Score Summary table provides a quick reference for what qualities
are measured by each ability, what races increase which abilities, and what classes
consider each ability particularly important.

You generate your character’s six ability scores randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and
record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more
times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to save time or don’t like the idea of
randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14,
13, 12, 10, 8.

Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six
abilities to assign scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your race
choice.

After assigning your ability scores, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability
Scores and Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the
table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down).
Write the modifier next to each of your scores.

**BUILDING KRIEG THE KRIEGER, STEP 3**
Bob decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for Krieg’s abilities.
Since he’s a fighter, he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next-highest, 14, goes
in Constitution. Krieg might be a brash fighter, but Bob decides he wants the man to be
older, wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent scores in Wisdom and Charisma. After
applying his racial benefits (increasing all of Krieg’s ability scores by 1), Krieg’s ability
scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 11 (+0), Constitution 15 (+
2), Intelligence 9 (–1), Wisdom 14 (+2), Charisma 13 (+1).

Bob fills in Krieg’s final hit points: 10 + his Constitution modifier of +2, for a total of 12
hit points.


##### Variant: Customizing Ability Scores

At your Dungeon Master’s option, you can use this variant for determining your ability
scores. The method described here allows you to build a character with a set of ability
scores you choose individually.

You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on
the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this
method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying racial
increases. You can’t have a score lower than 8.

This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high
numbers and three low ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above
average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers between those
extremes.

## 4. Describe Your Character

Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh him or her
out as a person. Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what
he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in general terms.

Using the information in the Personality and Background section, you can flesh out your
character’s physical appearance and personality traits. Choose your character’s
alignment (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and ideals. The
Personality and Background section also helps you identify the things your character
holds most dear, called bonds, and the flaws that could one day undermine him or her.

Your character’s background describes where he or she came from, his or her original
occupation, and the character’s place in the D&D world. Your DM might offer additional
backgrounds beyond the ones included in the Personality and Background section, and
might be willing to work with you to craft a background that’s a more precise fit for your
character concept.

A background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and
proficiency in two skills, and it might also give you additional languages or proficiency
with certain kinds of tools. Record this information, along with the personality
information you develop, on your character sheet.

#### Your Character's Abilities

Take your character’s ability scores and race into account as you flesh out his or her
appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Intelligence might think
and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.

For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a
character with low Strength might be scrawny or plump.

A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low


Dexterity might be either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.

A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant
energy. A character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.

A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a
character with low Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.

A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of
what’s going on. A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or
oblivious.

A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a
graceful or intimidating presence. A character with a low Charisma might come across as
abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.

**BUILDING KRIEG THE KRIEGER, STEP 4**
Bob fills in some of Krieg’s basic details: his name, his sex (male), his height and weight,
and his alignment (lawful neutral). His high Strength and Constitution suggest a healthy,
athletic body, and his low Intelligence suggests a degree of forgetfulness.

Bob decides that Krieg comes from a line of soldiers, from the Death World of Krieg. He
grew up performing standard Krieg duties, like cleaning the latrine and maintaining his
lasgun. But Krieg has a heroic destiny—to slaughter all who oppose the Imperium—so
Krieg chooses the folk hero background for his character. He notes the proficiencies and
special feature this background gives him.

Bob has a pretty clear picture of Krieg’s personality in mind, so he skips the personality
traits suggested in the folk hero background, noting instead that Krieg is a caring,
sensitive man who genuinely enjoys the death of his enemies, but hides his joy behind
the cold loyalty of serving the Imperium. He chooses the ideal of fairness from the list in
his background, noting that Krieg believes that no one is above the law.

Given his history, Krieg’s bond is obvious: he aspires to one day reclaim his home world
of Krieg. His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature—he has a soft spot for orphans
and wayward souls, leading him to show mercy even when it might not be warranted.

## 5. Choose Equipment

Your class and background determine your character’s starting equipment, including
weapons, armor, and other adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your character


sheet. All such items are detailed in the Equipment section.

Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase
your starting equipment. You have a number of gelt (g) to spend based on your class, as
shown in the Equipment section. Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear
in that section.

Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry. Try not to purchase
equipment with a total weight (in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15.
"Using Ability Scores" has more information on carrying capacity.

#### Armor Class

Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in
battle. Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you
carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor or carry shields,
however.

Without armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier.
If your character wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your AC using the rules
in the Equipment section. Record your AC on your character sheet.

Your character needs to be proficient with armor and shields to wear and use them
effectively, and your armor and shield proficiencies are determined by your class. There
are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a shield if you lack the required proficiency,
as explained in the Equipment section.

Some spells and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC. If you have
multiple features that give you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose which
one to use.

#### Weapons

For each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack
with the weapon and the damage you deal when you hit.

When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus
(but only if you are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier.

```
⦁ For attacks with melee weapons, use your Strength modifier for attack and
damage rolls. A weapon that has the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use
```

```
your Dexterity modifier instead.
⦁ For attacks with ranged weapons, use your Dexterity modifier for attack and
damage rolls. A melee weapon that has the thrown property, such as a handaxe,
can use your Strength modifier instead.
```
**BUILDING KRIEG THE KRIEGER, STEP 5**
Bob writes down the starting equipment from the fighter class and the folk hero
background. His starting equipment includes chain mail and a shield, which combine to
give Krieg an Armor Class of 18.

For Krieg’s weapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe and two handaxes. His battleaxe is a
melee weapon, so Krieg uses his Strength modifier for his attacks and damage. His
attack bonus is his Strength modifier (+3) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +

5. The battleaxe deals 1d8 kinetic damage, and Krieg adds his Strength modifier to the
damage when he hits, for a total of 1d8 + 3 kinetic damage. When throwing a handaxe,
Krieg has the same attack bonus (handaxes, as thrown weapons, use Strength for
attacks and damage), and the weapon deals 1d6 + 3 kinetic damage when it hits.

## 6. Come Together

Most characters don’t work alone. Each character plays a role within a party, a group of
adventurers working together for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation
greatly improve your party’s chances to survive the many perils in the worlds of
Warhammer 40k. Talk to your fellow players and your DM to decide whether your
characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts of missions the group
might undertake.

## Beyond 1st Level

As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains
experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified
experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called gaining a level.

#### Class Features and Hit Dice

When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as
detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your
ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You
can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus
increases at certain levels.


Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your
Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your hit point
maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is
the average result of the die roll (rounded up).

When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1
for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level fighter has a Constitution
score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to
18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then
increases by 8.

#### XP and Proficiency Bonus Progression

The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels
from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level.
Consult the information in your character's class description to see what other
improvements you gain at each level.

#### Tiers of Play

The shading in the Character Advancement table shows the four tiers of play. The tiers
don’t have any rules associated with them; they are a general description of how the
play experience changes as characters gain levels.

In the first tier (levels 1–4), characters are effectively apprentice adventurers. They are
learning the features that define them as members of particular classes, including the
major choices that flavor their class features as they advance (such as a techie’s
Technological Tradition or a fighter’s Martial Archetype). The threats they face are
relatively minor, usually posing a danger to local towns or obscure planets.

In the second tier (levels 5–10), characters come into their own. Many spellcasters gain
access to 3rd-level spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of power with
spells such as _fireball_ and _lightning bolt_. At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain the
ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These characters have become important,
facing dangers that threaten planets and worlds.

In the third tier (levels 11–16), characters have reached a level of power that sets them
high above the ordinary populace and makes them special even among adventurers. At
11th level, many spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells, some of which create
effects previously impossible for player characters to achieve. Other characters gain


features that allow them to make more attacks or do more impressive things with those
attacks. These mighty adventurers often confront threats to whole solar systems and
regions.

At the fourth tier (levels 17–20), characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features,
becoming heroic (or villainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of the sector or
even the fundamental order of the galaxy might hang in the balance during their
adventures.

# Chapter 2: Races

Although the species within the galaxy are innumerable, these are the most commonly
found that will involve themselves in the stories and adventures that take place.

## Ability Score Increases

Any race you choose gets a trait called Ability Score Increase. This increase reflects an
archetypal bit of excellence of that race within the world. For example, if you’re a squat,
your Constitution increases by 2, because squats are exceptionally hardy. This increase
doesn’t apply to every squat, just to squat adventurers, and it exists to reinforce an
archetype. That reinforcement is appropriate if you want to lean into the archetype, but
it’s unhelpful if your character doesn’t conform to the archetype.

If you’d like your character to follow their own path, you may ignore your Ability Score
Increase trait and assign ability score increases tailored to your character. Here’s how to
do it: take any ability score increase you gain in your race or subrace and apply it to an
ability score of your choice. If you gain more than one increase, you can’t apply those
increases to the same ability score, and you can’t increase a score above 20.

For example, if the Ability Score Increase trait of your race or subrace increases your
Constitution by 2 and your Wisdom by 1, you could instead increase your Intelligence by
2 and your Charisma by 1.

## Eldar

Eldar take pride in knowing that they existed for thousands of years before the rise of
humanity, and also cultivated one of the longest-withstanding empires that the galaxy
has seen. Within the span of the eldar’s time, they managed to section off a part of the
warp known as the webway for their own personal use.
The fall of the eldar empire was heralded by the birth of the Chaos God Slaanesh in a
location now known as the Eye of Terror. The birth of the Dark Prince was created from
the combined eldar’s lust for drugs, pleasure, and euphoria, creating so much that it
eventually polluted the warp and created this new Chaos God, known as She-Who-
Thirsts to the Aeldari people.
When making your eldar, consider how their heritage affects them. How has the fall
of the eldar affected you, and do you think the next great coming of the eldar is yet to
come? Are you selfish and desire to amass power for yourself to survive the inevitable
extinction of your kind, or are you carefree and accept the inevitable end to come, as all
things are?


#### Eldar Traits

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.
**_Age._** Although eldar reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the
eldar understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly
experience. An eldar typically claims adulthood around the age of 100 and can live to be
750 years old.
**_Alignment._** Eldar love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean towards
the gentler aspects of chaos. They value their freedom and culture, and they are more
often good than not. The dark eldar are an exception; they are more evil or neutral than
good.
**_Size._** Eldar range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is
Medium.
**_Speed._** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
**_Darkvision._** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision
in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were
bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness,
only shades of gray.
**_Eldar Agility._** Your reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed.
When you move on your tum in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the
turn. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your
turns.
**_Keen Senses._** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.
**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Eldar and Low Gothic. Eldar is fluid, with
subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Eldar literature is rich and varied, and their
songs and poems are some of the most complicated of all written languages.

#### Craftworld Eldar Traits

Your ancestors managed to escape the birth of the Dark Prince by riding upon large
ships known as Craftworlds. As a craftworld eldar, you live a more nomadic, spacefaring
life, and are well-adjusted to the webway and its intricacies.

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.
**_Artistic Heritage._** You are proficient in one musical instrument and set of artisans’
tools of your choice.
**_Craftworld Weapon Training._** You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword,
carbine, and assault rifle.
**_Clear Mind._** You have resistance to psionic damage, and you have advantage on
saving throws against being charmed.


#### Dark Eldar Traits

In order to hide their presence from the Dark Prince, your ancestors have tortured and
maimed victims and prisoners for centuries. As a result, dark eldar culture has become
twisted and diabolical, often filled with subterfuge, greed, and violence in order to
sustain themselves.

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Charisma score increases by 1.
**_Dark Eldar Proficiencies._** You are proficient with the poisoner’s kit and the torturer’s
kit.
**_Show No Weakness._** Dark Eldar are careful not to show weakness in front of their
allies, for fear of losing status. If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a
saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of creatures you can
see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). Once you use this trait, you can’t use
it again until you finish a short or long rest.
**_Sneak Attack._** If you surprise a creature and hit it with an attack on your first turn in
combat, the attack deals an extra 2d6 damage to it. You can use this trait only once per
combat.
**_Extra Language._** You can speak, read, and write Underworld.

#### Exodite Eldar Traits

Your ancestors fled before the collapse of the great eldar empire, and settled on
maiden worlds, cultivating new lives and cultures.

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Wisdom score increases by 1.
**_Beast Speech._** You can communicate simple ideas with beasts using sounds and
gestures.
**_Wild Survivalism._** You are proficient with your choice of the Nature or Survival skill.
Additionally, you can roll Nature and Survival checks with advantage when attempting
to recall information about beasts and when tracking beasts.
**_Mask of the Wild._** You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured
by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.

## Gretchin

Gretchin are a smaller subspecies of ork, and are regarded as the lesser species when
compared to the orks due to their lack of strength and inferiority in battle. Orks usually
resolve the gretchins as living shields, use them to clear landmines, and sometimes even


as emergency rations.
Gretchin are adherent to ork culture: war and the WAAAGH! still runs deep within
their blood. Even so, most Gretchin have to be forced into battle by other orks in order
to ensure that the Gretchin stay in the battle. Basically all gretchin work as slaves for
orks or some other figure of authority.
When creating a gretchin, think about what their experiences with orks are like. Are
they treated as inferior, as most gretchins are? Have you seen your fellow gretchins
used as fodder to clear landmines and soak up bullets? If you left ork culture, was it in
search of power, or to find somewhere where you weren’t going to die?

#### Gretchin Traits

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Constitution
score increases by 1.
**_Age._** Gretchin reach maturity at about 3 years of age. It is not known how long a
gretchin can live, as most die prematurely.
**_Alignment._** As a gretchin, you are privy to ork society and the chaos of war that it
brings, being inclined towards chaos.
**_Size._** Gretchin are between 3 and 4 feet tall and weigh between 20 to 60 pounds.
Your Size is Small.
**_Speed._** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
**_Darkvision._** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light,
and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of
gray.
**_Fury of the Small._** When you damage a creature with an attack or a power and the
creature’s size is larger than yours, you can cause the attack or power to deal extra
damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your level. You can use this feature a
number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses at
the end of a long rest.
**_Regeneration._** When maimed or mutilated by a weapon that does not deal fire
damage, you are able to replace the missing limb by restitching it on through botched
surgery, or by regenerating it over a period of one week.
**_Nimble Escape._** You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each
of your turns.
**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Low Gothic and Orkish.

## Human

Inside of the Imperium of Mankind on Holy Terra, the God-Emperor of Mankind rests
upon the Golden Throne, and has been for 10,000 years. It is unknown to the common
man what occurs on Terra and what the God-Emperor of Mankind truly does, but any


devout devotee to the Imperial Creed knows that the God-Emperor is simply managing
all of His vast planets and armies under His mighty hand from the Golden Throne of
Terra.

Humans inside of the Imperium can vary widely, from feral worlders that have only seen
Imperials when they retrieve their military tithes from villages, to the nobles of hive
worlds, sprawling cities condensed atop of itself to form mighty spires that can reach
the clouds.

The majority of humans within the galaxy reside within the Imperium, or within its
borders. Due to this, even if you are not born in Imperial space, most humans know of
the Imperium: what it stands for, the Imperial Creed that reveres the God-Emperor, and
its vast hands that stretch over millions of planets and untold trillions of people.

**_Chaos._** Since the Horus Heresy and the Long War, humans have been lured to the
powers of Chaos, whether it be by subjugation of their planets, or because they rather
be free from the iron hand of the Imperium. Humans that fight under the forces of
Chaos are oftentimes under the leadership of a warband, a dark apostle, or an apostate.
Although the forces of Chaos are able to form competent societies and some forms of
civilization, this is rarely the case, as their innate calling to the Ruinous Powers cause
them to seek greater journeys, for glory or power.

**_Tau._** Under the Tau Empire, humans are able to live soundly in a caste known as
gue'vesa. Under this system, they are treated similarly to second-class citizens, but are
not necessarily treated unfairly. Many humans are sent off in propaganda fleets to
attempt to garner other humans towards their cause.

Skills. You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.
Feat. You gain one feat of your choice.
```
## Kroot

Kroot are humanoid creatures that typically possess a beak, two arms, and two legs. The
word “typically” is used due to the kroot’s innate ability to consume the flesh of a
creature, eventually inspiring genetic mutations similar to the traits the creature
possessed.
After multiple generations of consuming one specific type of creature, kroot are able
to develop traits resembling that prey. These traits enable some groups of kroot to
develop psychic potential, immense strength, or boast a more powerful intellect.
Kroot are led by “shapers,” which is one amongst a tribe that designates what type
of prey the kroot should focus on consuming more than the others. This shaper is often
the oldest, wisest, or perhaps the strongest in its tribe.


The kroot were found by the Tau Empire, and joined forces under the Tau Empire to
serve as auxiliary units. Some kroot can be found roaming the galaxy as mercenaries,
traders, and bounty hunters.

that can be digested. When you devour a creature in this way, you can choose to gain an
acquired trait, as shown in the Acquired Traits table below. In order for a creature to
give a trait after you consume them, the creature must meet the trait prerequisite. For
example, in order to gain the Powerful Build trait, you must consume a creature size
Large or larger, or a creature that already has the Powerful Build trait. You can only gain
the benefits of one trait at a time.

```
## Mutant

True mutants are ostracized from the Imperium, for better or worse. Mutants have
genetic abnormalities as a result of their heritage or warp exposure, and progressed
mutants are often shot on sight in the Imperium. Most mutants that possess minor
mutations, such as an extra ear or finger, are able to live mostly in peace, or seek out
surgery to correct their abnormalities. However, if surgery is not available, or if the
Ecclesiarchy influence is rampant, the mutants are forced to live underground or in the
recluses of society.

Although mutants are most often humans, any race could become mutants with enough
warp exposure, including races mostly made from metal and machine.

#### Mutant Traits

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Constitution increases by 2, and one other ability score
of your choice increases by 1.
**_Age._** Due to their mutated nature, mutants can live up to hundreds of years longer
than regular humans, but often die before that due to violence.

tall. Weights can vary from 100 to 300 pounds. Your size is Medium.
**_Speed._** Your walking speed is 30.
**_Darkvision._** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light,
and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of


gray.

characteristics. You choose one enhancement now and a second one at 5th level. At 1st
level, choose from the following options:
**Manta Glide.** Your wings can slow your fall and allow you to glide. When you fall and
aren’t incapacitated, you can subtract up to 100 feet from the fall when calculating fall

arms. Choose whether they’re both claws or tentacles. Each of these appendages is a
natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, the
target takes kinetic damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the kinetic
damage normal for an unarmed strike. Immediately after hitting, you can try to grapple
the target as a bonus action. These appendages can’t precisely manipulate anything and
can’t wield weapons, enhanced items, or other specialized equipment.
**_Carapace_****.** Your skin in places is covered by a thick shell. You gain a +1 bonus to AC
when you’re not wearing heavy armor.
**_Acid Stream_****.** When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks
with a stream of acid from glands in your mouths, targeting one creature or object you
can see within 30 feet of you. The target takes 2d10 acid damage unless it succeeds on a
Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your
proficiency bonus. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 11th level (3d10) and
17th level (4d10).

**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Low Gothic, and your choice of Chaos,
Heretic, or Underworld.

## Ogryn

Ogryn are massive abhumans, deathly loyal, and dumb. They are covered in bumps and
unsightly lumps, and lug around massive bulky frames. They are regarded as great
frontline fighters in the Imperial Guard, are great at following orders, but barely have
two brain cells to rub together.
The Ogryn typically face discrimination within the Imperium, but their tithes to the
Imperial Guard allow them to remain within the realm of acceptable mutations. Their


immense combat strength and gently guided nature allow them to embrace the culture
found within the military with relative ease.

#### Ogryn Traits

Your ogryn character has certain traits deriving from your abhuman ancestry.

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength
score increases by 1.

rest.
**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Low Gothic, and your choice of Imperial
Codes or Tribal.

## Ork

Orks are violent. Orks are numerous. They often use crude naming conventions, such as
referring to smaller orks as“boyz” and “gitz.” The phenomena known as the “gestalt
field” causes things to come true if enough orks believe it. This is why many ork vehicles
are red: because red things are faster.

Orks are fungal creatures, and reproduce using spores, even if they do not consciously
recognize this. These spores are spread passively throughout the ork’s life, and spread
even more when they die. Fire is one of the only methods of stopping orks from


reproducing.

Orks come in a variety of flavors: knobs are big orks that lead small groups into battle.
Warbosses are orks that have become fairly intelligent, and are able to lead masses into
battle and coordinate strategies. Techboyz can work with technology and somehow
make it work, and weirdboyz are psykers that need to remove the top of their skull, lest
their brain become so big it wouldn’t fit otherwise. Ork society is primarily built around
klanz and tribes in a barbarian fashion, with warbosses at the top of the totem pole,
warlords leading smaller warbands, and knobs leading small groups of ork boyz.

#### Ork Traits

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength
score increases by 1.
**_Age._** Orks are known to live for short times, and for long times. When short, it is
because of war. When long, it’s because of war making them strong enough to live
longer. There are no orks that have died from old age, and most orks reach maturity at a
few months old.
**_Alignment._** Orks care little for authority and live in a violent society ruled by the
strong. Orks lean strongly towards chaotic alignments.
**_Size._** An ork can reach from 6 feet tall to 7 feet tall and between 200 and 300
pounds. Your size is Medium.
**_Speed._** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
**_Colors._** Orks can paint themselves colors to varying effects. At the end of a long rest,
you can choose a color to paint yourself, to gain one of the following effects. You can
only paint yourself one color at a time.
⦁ **_Red._** Red is the fastest color. You ignore the movement penalties of
nonenhanced difficult terrain.
⦁ **_Green._** Green is the strongest color. You gain proficiency in Athletics and
Intimidation.
⦁ **_Black._** Black is the hardest color. While you are not wearing heavy armor, your
AC is increased by 1.
⦁ **_Camouflage._** Camouflage is the hardest color to see. You know the psychic
power _invisibility_ , and you can cast it, only targeting yourself. You can choose
Wisdom or Charisma to be your psycasting ability for this power. Once you use
this trait, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.
⦁ **_Yellow-and-Black Hazard Stripes._** You have advantage on Deception checks to
convince other orks that you are, indeed, an Iron Warrior space marine.
**_Regeneration._** Due to their fungal nature, orks are able to regenerate lost limbs and
body parts over a period of time. When maimed or mutilated by a weapon that does not
deal fire damage, an ork is able to replace the missing limb by restitching it on through


botched surgery, or by regenerating it over a period of one week.
**_Powerful Build._** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying
capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

hostile creature you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than
you started.
**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Low Gothic and Orkish. Orkish is a brutal
language, made of simple physical gestures, grunting, and violent motions.

## Ratling

Ratlings are a species of abhuman that range from three to four feet tall. Being
abhumans, they are typically discriminated against, but they are regarded highly as
snipers in the Imperial Guard. Ratlings are on the list of acceptable mutations listed by
the Imperium.

As a ratling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. In the
Imperial Guard, ratlings are used as snipers. Many ratlings lead a life of petty crime,
making use of their smaller stature to nimbly dash in and out of hazards and make a
quick escape.

#### Ratling Traits

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score
increases by 1.
**_Age._** A ratling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle
of his or her second century.

them to learn towards a chaotic view of life. Ratlings conscripted into the Imperial
Guard are more likely to be lawful in respect to authority.

Small.

creature that is at least one Size larger than you.
**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Low Gothic, and your choice of Imperial
Codes or Underworld.

## Tainted

The tainted are the result of the unholy touch by chaos itself. Many tainted actively
chose to become chaos-touched, relishing in their newfound powers. However, tainted
can be the result of extended exposure to the warp, or even the result of an unholy
union of daemons, warp creatures, heretics, or otherwise.

Tainted are derived from any race’s bloodline, and in the broadest sense possible, still
look as such. However, their unholy heritage has left a clear imprint on their
appearance. Many of the tainted have large horns, tails, pointed teeth, split pupils,
discolored skin, and other abnormalities. It isn’t uncommon for tainted to be killed at
birth or die very young—whether from a merciful execution or as a sacrifice to a greater
power.

Tainted subsist in small minorities found on the outlier of civilization. On feudal and
feral worlds, they can be regarded as an ill omen but allowed to exist in peace, for fear
their death will bring a curse upon the tribe that birthed them. Other tainted may be
found by a radical inquisitor or chaos warband, using their powers for a purpose rather
than being shunned by society.

#### Tainted Traits

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Charisma score increases by 2.
**_Age._** Tainted typically can live much longer than their original race’s lifespan, but
their lives often end far before that.
**_Alignment._** Tainted might not have an innate tendency toward evil, but many of them
end up there. Evil or not, an independent nature inclines many tainted toward a chaotic
alignment.
**_Size._** Tainted are about the same size and build as their original race. Your size is
Medium.
**_Speed._** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
**_Darkvision._** Thanks to your unholy nature, you have superior vision in dark and dim
conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in
darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Chaos and Low Gothic.
**_Chaos Taint._** You are tainted by chaos, which grants you unique effects based on
which god dominates the corruption in your blood. Choose one of the following


allegiances that dictate your corruption and gain its traits, listed below.

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Wisdom score increases by 1.

level, you can cast the _hellish rebuke_ power as a 2nd-level power once with this trait and
regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can
cast the _darkness_ power once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you
finish a long rest. Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your psycasting ability for these
powers and they are psychic powers for you.

## Tau

The Tau are a young, humanoid and technologically-advanced intelligent species that
are fighting to expand their ideal of the “Greater Good” to all of the intelligent species
of the galaxy. The Tau claim to be a peaceful race when possible, but may conquer a
planet when their peaceful overtures are declined.

Tau society is led by a secretive caste known as the Ethereals, which are able to
command the respect of the Tau with ease. This has led to opponents of the Tau
wondering if perhaps the Ethereal caste has a secret lurking behind their leadership
capabilities.

## Techfused

#### Machine and Flesh

The union of metal and flesh spawns the techfused: humanoids obsessed with the ideal
of adding more machinery and technology to their body. Whether it be out of some
strange fetishization of metal or to become closer to their perception of the Machine
God, these creatures are made of more cogs and machinery, intertwined into their
organs and skin, rather than actual organic body parts.

Any humanoid race can become techfused, but most often the humans that worship the
Cult of the Machine God and orks that have become mutilated from countless battles
eventually become techfused.

#### Techfused Traits

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one ability score
of your choice increases by 1.

hundreds of years longer than their natural lifespan.
**_Alignment._** Techfused are driven to alignments designated by their original race.
Members of the Cult of the Machine God are driven towards lawful alignments, while
those who pursue cybernetic enhancement for the purpose of being liberated from the
constraints of the flesh can lean towards chaotic alignments.
**_Size._** Techfused are the same size and height of their original race, with an additional
10 to 300 pounds added due to their cybernetics enhancements. Your Size is Medium.
**_Speed._** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
**_Constructed Resilience._** You were forged to have remarkable fortitude, represented
by the following benefits:

⦁ You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have
resistance to poison damage.
⦁ You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.
⦁ You are immune to nonenhanced disease.
⦁ You don’t need to sleep, and you can’t be put to sleep.

inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it

enhanced with armor:

# Chapter 2.1: Expanded Races

Across the galaxy, innumerable species of aliens have made their presence known.
Many of these have been forced to merge into a larger faction in order to survive, or
rely on nomadic spacefaring travel to make their living. Whatever the cause, the races
detailed in this chapter display uncommon xeno or subspecies of human that can be
found within the galaxy.

Consult with your GM before playing any of these exotic races, as their presence in a
story can drastically change or alter the playing environment.

## Ability Score Increases

Any race you choose gets a trait called Ability Score Increase. This increase reflects an
archetypal bit of excellence of that race within the world. For example, if you’re a squat,
your Constitution increases by 2, because squats are exceptionally hardy. This increase
doesn’t apply to every squat, just to squat adventurers, and it exists to reinforce an
archetype. That reinforcement is appropriate if you want to lean into the archetype, but
it’s unhelpful if your character doesn’t conform to the archetype.

If you’d like your character to follow their own path, you may ignore your Ability Score
Increase trait and assign ability score increases tailored to your character. Here’s how to
do it: take any ability score increase you gain in your race or subrace and apply it to an
ability score of your choice. If you gain more than one increase, you can’t apply those
increases to the same ability score, and you can’t increase a score above 20.

For example, if the Ability Score Increase trait of your race or subrace increases your
Constitution by 2 and your Wisdom by 1, you could instead increase your Intelligence by
2 and your Charisma by 1.

## Beastman

Within the home of many a grieving mother, a child has been born far worse off than
death. Twisting horns curl around the goat mouth that weeps for its mother’s milk. A
beastman is born. Within the Imperium, these foul abominations are treated as
tolerable at best. At worst, the family that begat such spawn is put under scrutiny, by
local police forces, or perhaps even the Inquisition itself.
Regardless of reason, beastmen are commonly put to work in one of two ways, should
they be allowed to live: either put in a forgotten mine, slaving away for the rest of its


miserable existence, or into the ranks of the Imperial Guard—at least in death, it may be
validated in the Emperor’s eyes, should He be merciful upon such a wretched creature.
Many feral worlds, feudal worlds, and penal colonies make use of beastmen, as their
raw physical strength has found uses in the backwater planets willing to overlook such a
deformity. Despite these deformities, most beastmen have been reported to be
remarkably loyal to those who treat them well.
Even still, many beastmen have fallen prey to the clutches of Chaos, bathing in the gifts
of the Dark Gods. It is well known that beastmen are favored by the dark gods...

#### Beastman Traits

## Blank

Blanks are soulless humans born with a unique power that causes them to be resistant
to the powers of the warp. Sometimes called pariahs, nulls, or untouchables, these
humans possess the rare “Pariah Gene,” which is estimated to occur within one out of a
billion humans. People that spend time around blanks feel an uneasy presence


emanating from them. Due to this, many blanks are outcasts from their society, or die at
a young age due to being exiled.

Blanks are a natural anathema to the warp, psykers, and daemons by their very
existence. As such, they are in high demand for inquisitors, the Imperial Guard, or other
military factions that fight against the forces of Chaos or psykers once they are
discovered.

Within the Imperium, some blanks that are discovered early are indoctrinated to
become one of the Temple Assassins, the Culexus, where their anti-psychic abilities are
honed to a fine point. There exists a small enclave known as the Sisters of Silence on
Terra that accepts female blanks into their ranks to fight against the threats that erupt
around Terra.

## Genestealers


Genestealers infest colonies and cities belonging to other creatures, repopulating with
their peoples and attempting to establish a Genestealer Cult, eventually leading a
Tyranid hive fleet to the planet to consume it in its entirety.

Genestealer Acolytes are the result of generations of implanted genes into humanoids,
resulting in a genestealer-human hybrid that appears like a human, but with noticeable
differences, such as several arms, more rows of teeth, hunched postures, and other
traits similar to a mutant.

#### Genestealer Acolyte Traits

Genestealer Acolytes are some of the earliest generations that emerge during the
upstart of a Genestealer cult. Resembling both tyranids and humanoids, these creatures
typically possess multiple arms, and are usually bred for violence and aggression.

manipulate anything and can’t wield weapons, activate enhanced items, or other
specialized equipment.

linked in this way, you are able to psychically communicate through telepathy to any
other tyranid within 60 feet of you.
**_Tyranid Physiology._** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed,
frightened, poisoned, or put to sleep.
**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Low Gothic.


#### Genestealer Neophyte Traits

Neophytes are the product of multiple generations of genestealers breeding with their
host species. Neophytes are nearly indistinguishable from normal humans, with perhaps
only a few physical abnormalities that could give you away on closer inspection.
Neophytes boast more intelligence than their counterparts, and are able to intermingle
in politics and affairs.

increases by 1.

and add it to the total.

## Half-Eldar

You are a half-breed—the spawn of the ancient eldar race, and something else. This
other half is typically human, but could be almost any race that can already mate with
humans. As part of your Eldar heritage, you may face the same fears and concerns that
craftworlders and the dark eldar face: the Dark Prince. Perhaps this has caused you to
inherit a distant soulstone from one of your relatives, or perhaps you were driven to
steal and take one. More sinister half-eldar may give in to a more primal nature, instead


resorting to torture to hide their presence.

It is rumored that in some of the far reaches of the galaxy, gene splicing using eldar DNA
into humans is used to create humans with more agile frames.

#### Half-Eldar Traits

Your half-Eldar character has some qualities in common with eldar and some that are
unique to half-Eldar.

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores
of your choice increase by 1.
**_Age._** Half-Eldar mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the
age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.
**_Alignment._** Half-Eldar share the chaotic bent of their eldar heritage. They value both
personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor
desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others’ demands, and sometimes prove
unreliable, or at least unpredictable.
**_Size._** Half-Eldar are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your
size is Medium.
**_Speed._** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
**_Darkvision._** Thanks to your eldar blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim
conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in
darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
**_Eldar Ancestry._** You have an additional trait based on your ancestry. Choose one of the
following:
⦁ **_Clear Mind (Craftworld)._** You have resistance to psionic damage, and you have
advantage on saving throws against being charmed.
⦁ **_Show No Weakness (Dark Eldar)._** If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability
check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of
creatures you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). Once you
use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
⦁ **_Sneak Attack (Dark Eldar)._** If you surprise a creature and hit it with an attack on
your first turn in combat, the attack deals an extra 2d6 damage to it. You can use
this trait only once per combat.

phenomena.

of your choice.

## Jokaero

Jokaero are a primate-like race that are regarded as tolerable xenos by Imperial
Mandate. They have a fascination with technology, and are able to manipulate and
upgrade it, although it is not fully understood how. Jokaero seem to possess a
suboptimal intelligence for a sapient humanoid species, but are able to create
technological marvels that parallels the Dark Age of Technology. Jokaero tend to be
unpredictable when it comes to their affinity with technology, but due to their
lackadaisical disposition and aversion to aggression, they have been tolerated as tech
monkeys and a boon to those that they choose to work with.

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score
increases by 1.

```
⦁ The item’s weight is doubled or halved.
⦁ The item can be activated or deactivated as a bonus action to glow bright light in
a 10-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
⦁ The item cannot be disarmed or removed from the wearer while the wearer is
not incapacitated.
⦁ When activated (no action required), the item plays a recorded message of up to
25 words that can be heard up to 10 feet away. This message can be no longer
than 6 seconds.
```

```
⦁ The item emits a particular smell or odor and has a particular taste.
```
This benefit can only apply to one item at a time. If you apply an effect to a new item,
the previous item loses its benefit granted from this trait.
**_Tech Resistance._** You have advantage on Dexterity and Intelligence saving throws
caused by tech powers.
**_Technical Aptitude._** You have proficiency in the Tech skill.
**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Low Gothic, Jokaero, and Tribal. Jokaero is a
language that consists of grunts and hollering, and is rarely spoken by species other than
Jokaero.

## Lacrymole

The lacrymole is an oddity amongst species found within the galaxy. They appear as
typical humanoids of average stature, height, and weight, except with one key
difference: their physical appearance is constantly shifting and changing, a myriad of
colors, until they decide to imitate the appearance of another humanoid race. As such,
the lacrymole most often lives inside of other civilizations, such as the Imperium, where
they can thrive in secrecy. Lacrymoles possess vampire-like teeth, and are able to feed
off of the blood of creatures to sustain themselves. Out of all of the species listed as
intolerable in most societies, the lacrymole is one of the most hated, hunted, and
despised creatures to exist within the galaxy at large.

of your choice increases by 1.

You can also adjust your height and weight, but not so much that your size changes. You
can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game
statistics change. You can’t duplicate the appearance of a creature you’ve never seen,


and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have.
Your clothing and equipment aren’t changed by this trait.
You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you
die.
**_Lacrymole Instincts._** You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice:
Deception, Insight, Intimidation, and Persuasion.
**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Low Gothic and two other languages of your
choice.

## Necron

Deep within the Tomb Worlds of long-forgotten worlds, the Necrons wait. Made of
super-advanced metals and stripped of most of their intelligence, reasoning, and
thought, the Necron are robots hellbent on destroying the life forms present in the
galaxy. Few Necrons have intelligence capable of complex thought, reasoning, and
communication.

**GM NOTE**
Necron are constructs, and can’t be healed by most forms of standard healing. Because
of this, it is important that your player knows that they may be severely disadvantaged
compared to their party members due to lack of healing available to them.

score of your choice increases by 1.

darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
**_Necron Armor._** Your body is covered in necrodermis, and it gives you a base AC of 17
(your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). Wearing armor does not put you
below this number. If you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.
**_Sleepless._** When you take a long rest, you must spend at least four hours in an inactive,


motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn’t

amount of days equal to your level.
**_Warp Intolerance._** You are unable to manifest psychic powers. You cannot gain levels in
a class that has the psycasting feature.

## Ratman

Deep in the belly of every hive city, under every sewer grating, and rummaging through
every pile of rubble, is said to be a ratman. These selfish creatures are known to
scavenge wherever they can, and are unwanted by most civilized societies. They form
small gangs of ratmen, bound together by the fragile hope of a meal or loot, and raid
overworld cities in an attempt to survive in the increasingly mechanistic worlds they find
themselves in.
Left unperturbed, ratmen tend to never be able to form societies and flourish, as
constant inbreeding and civil wars keep their populations down. Listed as one of the
biggest nuisances to the Imperium alongside mutants, xeno, and heretics, these ratmen
can be found negotiating with any xenos (if they listen to ratmen), living amongst
mutants (if they tolerate ratmen), and dealing with the factions of chaos (if they do not
kill ratmen). Ratmen are the most depraved, despicable, and lowest form of life the
galaxy has to offer.

#### Ratman Traits

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.
**_Age._** Ratmen reach adulthood at age 6, and can live up to 120 years, but rarely do so

use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


**_Pack Tactics._** You have advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of
your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to
perceive is in direct sunlight.
**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Low Gothic and Underworld.

## Stryxis

Stryxis are known throughout the galaxy as scummy traders and peddlers. Typically
covered by a brown robe, the only noticeable thing about these humanoids is their pug-
like faces and appear genderless to the onlooker, with gangly limbs and four small,
beady eyes. The stryxis have been known to peddle wares to Imperials, the Tau, chaos,
and anyone else willing to buy from them, except the eldar, whom they have an undying
grudge against for unknown reasons.
The stryxis are known as con men and schemers, and are known to have little regard
other than making a profit. Many stryxis make out their lives as nomads and wanderers,
and are known by Imperials to be indecisive traders, as their way of valuing goods is far
different than what most intelligent races can perceive. Stryxis are keen on hoarding
loot, regardless of value, and attempting to sell it off for whatever they perceive as the
price.

increases by 1.

## Tarellian

The Tarellian are a species of doglike humanoids, known as “dog-soldiers,” that are
near-extinct due to multiple threats against their species. They possess broad shoulders
and a voracious maw in the shape of a canine’s. They once had a thriving civilization
before Mankind virus-bombed many of their planets during the late 30th Millennium. In
the 40th Millennium, the tyranids destroyed one of their last remaining planets.
The remaining survivors are from sparse mercenary and nomadic populations that drift
amongst the stars. The Tau have employed many of the remaining Tarellian into their
ranks as mercenaries, or adopted them into their society.

## Thyrrus

#### The Squiddies

Referred to as “Squiddies” by Imperials, these strange xeno were nearly wiped out of
existence by the Imperial Guard. The Thyrrus are squid-like creatures with several eyes,
multi-jointed limbs. Thyrrus tend to disregard petty notions that other species refer to
as “survival” and “victory,” instead preferring to live their life as a performance. A
Thyrrus chef might destroy a kitchen, burn down an orphanage, and genocide an entire
race of people, if it means that it will make for an entertaining meal. Likewise, the
thyrrus treated war as a performance, leading to their near-extinction.
Thyrrus physiology includes a multitude of tentacles, skin that can change colors at will
for social and practical purposes, four eyes, cartilaginous bodies, a pseudomouth that
instead works more like a colander, and a naturally-occurring gas mask-like structure.
The end result is a creature that seems to care little about living, but is able to live in
extreme circumstances and environments.

#### Thyrrus Traits

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score
increases by 1.
**_Age._** Thyrrus reach adulthood at just over a decade, and can live up to a century.

strive towards chaotic alignments, and care little for good or evil.

8 feet tall. Their weight can range from 100 to 160 pounds. Your size is Medium.
**_Speed._** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
**_Camouflage._** Over the course of 1 minute, you can change your skin color and texture to
help camouflage yourself. When camouflaged to an environment, you can attempt to
hide even when you are only lightly obscured, such as in dim light, patchy fog, or
moderate foliage.


**_Dazzling Display._** When a creature you can see makes an attack roll against you, you can
use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll by causing your skin to shift into a
multitude of colors. You must use this trait before knowing whether the attack hits or
misses.
Using this trait causes your camouflage to reset. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it
again until you finish a short or long rest.
**_Performer._** For the thyrrus, a performance is a spice of life. You are proficient in the
Performance and Persuasion skills.
**_Strange Physiology._** You are naturally resistant to extreme conditions. You have
advantage on saving throws against nonenhanced diseases, and the effects of exposure
to extreme heat, cold, vacuum, and radiation from the environment. Additionally, you
can breathe underwater and in normally inhospitable areas, such as in areas of toxic
miasma or brackish water.
**_Language._** You can speak, read, and write Low Gothic and Thyrrus. The Thyrrus
language is filled with near-incomprehensible gibberish and every speaker seems to
have their own dialect to put their own flair on pronunciation and clarification.

## Vespid

The vespid race is made of humanoids that are covered in a chitin-like material, and that
have wings that allow them to be a valuable asset on the battlefield. Fighting alongside
the Tau in auxiliary, scout, and skirmishing units, the vespids are one of the main
advantages that allow the Tau to combat the Space Marines in combat due to their
flanking prowess and high mobility. The Imperials know vespids as “stingwings.” Vespids
have three eyes on their head, and their mouths are an arrangement of mandibles and
razor-like protrusions. Vespids form groups known as Strains, and are highly sought after
as mercenaries and in the Tau military.

#### Vespid Traits

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score
increases by 1.

80 to 160 pounds. Your size is Medium.

benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.
**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Low Gothic, Tau, and Vespid. Vespid is an
extremely complex language that consists of harsh and fast buzzing.

## Viskeon

The Viskeon are blue-skinned humanoid creatures that are cold-blooded, able to spit
acid, and have an uncanny ability to regenerate their lost limbs and organs. The Viskeon
homeworld was a hot and parched planet, dotted with jungles and plans, perfect for a
cold-blooded species.
Viskeons prize martial prowess, and view melee combat as one of the highest honors
possible; they prize melee combat so much that ranged combat is viewed as
dishonorable and cowardly in their society. When a tyranid incursion invaded their
home world, nearly all of the viskeons died, except for those off-world as mercenaries
or bounty hunters. To this day, viskeon mercenaries are a rare but prized sight to
behold.

#### Viskeon Traits

increases by 1.

an exhalation of acid in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must


make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier +
your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d8 acid damage on a failed save, and half as
much damage on a successful one. This damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th
level (3d8), 11th level (4d8), and 17th level (5d8). Once you use this trait, you can’t use it
again until you complete a short or long rest.

language on the verge of extinction, consisting of low hisses and grunts.

## Watcher in the Dark

On the remains of the planet of Caliban, the loyalist Space Marine chapter of the Dark
Angels make their home there. Deep within the caverns, the Watchers in the Dark
emerged, providing aid to the Dark Angels through menial labor, such as carrying tomes,
organizing scrolls, and maintaining armor and arms.

Little is known about the Watchers in the Dark besides their inherent aversion to the
forces of chaos, and their strange connection to the Dark Angels. Watchers tend to dress
in ceremonial robes, and are spotted close by wherever a Dark Angel might be.

The Watchers in the Dark are short, shadowy figures that typically dwell in the shadows
of the caverns within Caliban. They can be spotted carrying equipment and armaments
to the space marines of the Dark Angels on the battlefield, but little interaction is made
with them.

you are proficient with, a badge of your legion or Chapter, and a holy symbol (aquila) or
unholy symbol (any chaos god).

## Step 3: Role Features and Equipment (Background)

Although every space marine is able to fulfill almost any role necessary for battle, each
is trained for an individual purpose to specialize in to best benefit the war effort. Instead
of choosing a background, you choose a role you are assigned for. Additionally, you start
with the gear listed for your role instead of the gear given by your starting class.

If an item has a name in parentheses, it indicates the weapon stats available for the
item. For example, the apothecary’s equipment has a narthecium (shortsword),
indicating that the item can use the shortsword’s statistics in combat.

Choose one of the following roles below:

#### Apothecary

To best serve your battle-brothers, you maintain their physical health, and ensure that
they are able to recover as quickly as possible both in the midst of combat and after
missions. You are responsible for ensuring the health of your brothers, and should they
reap the reward of their duty, retrieving their precious geneseed to create more battle-
brothers to replenish casualties.

# Chapter 3: Classes

## Augmenticist

His fists a blur as they smash into an oncoming hail of bullets, a man made of more
metal than flesh springs over the police barricade and throws himself into the amassed
ranks of arbitrators. His movement is a flash as arbitrators are sent flying, until he alone
stands.
Taking a deep breath, a mutant feels the automatic pistons press into his back,
flushing his body with chems and stimulants to face the upcoming fight. In the pitch-
black darkness of the arena, his opponent approaches him, throwing blow after blow
into his body, only to reel back as his hands begin bleeding from the impact of flesh
upon metal.
A band of guardsmen crest over a final hill, until they spot the warboss—a ten-foot
tall ork, made of more metal than green flesh, his jaw made from the remnants of a
car’s bumper, and his chest fitted out to release exhaust and fumes with every rise of his
chest. The warboss turns, his eyes glowing a piercing red through the night, and revs up
the engines of his heart.
Whatever their implants, augmenticists are united in their love for upgrading their
bodies to best accommodate their desires. Whether it be to look like the biggest,
baddest ganger on the hab block, or to crush enemies with pulverizing blows,
cybernetics are the augmenticist’s bread and butter.

## Quick Build

You can make an augmenticist quickly by following these suggestions. First, make
Strength or Dexterity your highest ability modifier. Your next highest score should be

##### Integrated Weapon

At 1st level, you can integrate up to two weapons into your body. You can integrate a
weapon over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon
must be within your reach, and you integrate it into your body at the end of 1 hour. You
can't integrate weapons with the two-handed property into your body. While the
weapon is integrated, you gain the following benefits:

```
⦁ You can unsheathe one or more of your integrated weapons as part of the Attack
action on your turn, and you do not need a free hand to wield an integrated
weapon.
⦁ When you sheathe the weapon, it is undetectable by normal means.
⦁ While you are conscious, your integrated weapons can’t be removed from your
body against your will.
```
You can remove an integrated weapon over the course of 1 minute.

At 9th level, you can integrate up to 3 weapons into your body. At 13th level, you can
integrate up to 4 weapons into your body at a time.

##### Combat Augments

Also at 1st level, your combat augments allow you to use your integrated weapons to
overwhelm opponents with superior strength and speed. You gain the following benefits
while you are attacking with your integrated weapons:

```
⦁ You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for attack and damage rolls using
integrated weapons.
⦁ You can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your integrated weapon. This
damage increases as you level up, as shown in the Combat Augments Die column
in the Augmenticist table.
⦁ When you use the Attack action with an integrated weapon on your turn, you
can make an additional attack with a different integrated weapon as a bonus
action.
```

You can’t wear a shield and gain the benefits of this feature due to the clunky nature of
shields.

##### Overdrive

Starting at 2nd level, you can push your cybernetics beyond their usual limits, a process
known as overdrive. Your ability to push your body beyond its normal limits is
represented by your overdrive points, as shown in the Overdrive Points column of the
Augmenticist table.

You start with three overdrive features: targeted strikes, automatic defenses, and turbo
sprint. You learn more overdrive features as you gain levels in this class.

You regain all of your overdrive points when you complete a short or long rest, which
allows your internal systems to cool down and repair themselves.

Some of your overdrive features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the
feature's Effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

```
Overdrive save DC = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Constitution modifier
```
**_Targeted Strikes_**

Immediately after you take the Attack action and attack with an integrated weapon on
your turn, you can spend 1 overdrive point to make two attacks with a different
integrated weapon.

**_Automatic Defenses_**

You can spend 1 overdrive point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your
turn.

**_Turbo Sprint_**

You can spend 1 overdrive point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action
on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

##### Upgraded Movement

Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet. This bonus increases when you
reach certain augmenticist levels, as shown in the augmenticist table.

At 9th level, your auto-stabilizing cogitators allow you to move along vertical surfaces
and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.


##### Cybernetic Implants

When you reach 3rd level, you implant yourself with specific cybernetics to augment
your abilities. Your implants grant you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and
17th level.

##### Deflect Missiles

Starting at 3rd level, your cybernetics allow you to repel kinetic and energy-based
attacks. You can use your reaction to deflect the attack when you are hit by a ranged
weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by
1d10 + your Constitution modifier + your augmenticist level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can reflect the attack. If you reflect an attack in this
way, you can spend 1 overdrive point to make a ranged Attack (range 20 feet/60 feet)
with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just reflected, as part of the same
reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies,
and can use your combat augments die for the damage.

##### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase
one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your
choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##### Hydraulics

Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction to reduce any falling damage you take
by an amount equal to five times your augmenticist level.

Additionally, you can use your Dexterity score instead of your Strength score to
determine your jumping heights and distances.

##### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the
attack action on your turn.

##### Stunning Strike

Starting at 5th level, your blows can devastate even the strongest of foes. When you hit
a creature with an integrated weapon attack, you can expend 1 overdrive point to
attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be


stunned until the end of your next turn. Once a creature succeeds on a saving throw
against this feature, it is immune to this feature until the start of your next turn.

##### Enhanced Strikes

Starting at 6th level, your integrated weapons count as enhanced for the purpose of
overcoming resistance and immunity to nonenhanced attacks and damage.

##### Autonomy of Mind

Starting at 7th level, you can use a bonus action to end one effect on yourself that is
causing you to be charmed or frightened.

##### Evasion

At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects,
such as a dreadnought’s _barrage_ or a _fireball_ power. When you are subjected to an
effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you
instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you
fail.

##### Cybernetic Body

At 10th level, your heavily augmented body has made you immune to poisons and
nonenhanced diseases.

##### Omni-Lingual

Starting at 13th level, your integrated systems can identify and translate any spoken
language. Moreover, your integrated translators allow any creature that can understand
a language to understand what you say, as long as they speak at least one language.

##### Enhanced Core

Beginning at 14th level, your advanced augments grant you proficiency in all saving
throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 overdrive
point to reroll it and take the second result.

##### Mechanized Immortality

At 15th level, your mechanical body sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of
old age, and you can't be aged through enhanced means. You can no longer die of old
age, and you no longer need food or water.


Additionally, you can use an action to remove 1 level of exhaustion from yourself.

##### Integrated Cloaking

Beginning at 18th level, you can use your bonus action to spend 4 overdrive points to
activate a cloaking field, becoming invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have
resistance to all damage but psionic damage.

##### Perfected Augments

At 20th level, your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores increase by 2.
Additionally, when you score a critical hit, you regain 4 overdrive points.

#### Cybernetic Implants

Cybernetic implants are common throughout the galaxy, but only a select few dedicate
themselves to fully submerging themselves within the technology, and unlocking its
most intimate powers.

Most groups focus on one identity, such as the underhanded fighting utilized by hive
gangers, or the rigid military doctrine used in armies. All augmenticists rely on the same
basic cybernetics, only unlocking its true potential as they grow in power and
attunement to their technology. As such, an augmenticist needs to choose their
specialized cybernetic implants upon reaching 3rd level.

#### Combat Chem Implants

Combat chem implants are utilized for those who use drugs and stimulants to give them
the edge they need in combat.

##### Bonus Proficiencies

Your study of drugs gives you proficiency with alchemist’s supplies and the poisoner’s
kit.

##### Stim Injector

Starting when you choose these implants at 3rd level, you can inject stimulants into
your body, nullifying your pain. When you spend 1 or more overdrive points, such as on
targeted strikes, you gain an amount of temporary hit points equal to your Constitution
modifier (to a minimum of 1).


##### Focus Enhancer

Starting at 6th level, at the start of your turn, you can overflow your body with drugs to
increase your focus and precision (no action required). Until the start of your next turn,
you have advantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Once you use
this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest, or until you
use 3 overdrive points to use it again.

##### Adrenaline Reserve

Beginning at 11th level, you have a special pump dedicated to flood you with
adrenaline. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can spend 1 overdrive point (no
action required) to have 1 hit point instead.

##### Toxin Valves

Starting at 17th level, you can use a bonus action and spend 1 to 10 overdrive points to
coat your weapon in a deadly toxin. The toxin lasts for 1 minute, or until you strike a
creature and deal damage to it, consuming the toxin.

When you deal damage to a creature, it must make a Constitution saving throw, and it
takes 2d10 necrotic damage per overdrive point spent on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

#### Medicae Implants

Your implants are dedicated to healing, surgery, and sometimes murder.

##### Surgical Implements

Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Medicine skill. Additionally, you have
proficiency in chirurgeon’s tools, and you can add double your proficiency bonus when
making checks with these tools.

Additionally, you have a built-in trauma kit with unlimited uses, and you can use a bonus
action to stabilize creatures within 5 feet of you.

##### Healing Mechadendrite

Also at 3rd level, you gain a cybernetic arm that extends from your back, known as a
mechadendrite. This mechadendrite comes equipped with chirurgeon’s tools. This arm
can’t be used to grasp objects that weigh more than 10 pounds, and it can't effectively
use weapons or a shield.


As an action, you can spend 1 overdrive point to surgerize a creature within 5 feet,
restoring a number of hit points equal to a roll of your Combat Augments die + your
Constitution modifier.

When you use your targeted strikes, you can replace one of the attacks with a use of
this feature without spending an overdrive point for the healing.

##### Medicine Chute

Starting at 6th level, your mechadendrite carries a slew of medicine with you. When you
use Healing Mechadendrite on a creature, you can also end one nonenhanced disease
or one of the following conditions affecting the creature: blinded, deafened, paralyzed,
poisoned, or stunned.

##### Combat Stimulants

Starting at 11th level, when you use targeted strikes, you can replace each of the attacks
with a use of your Healing Mechadendrite, without spending overdrive points for
healing.

Additionally, after healing a creature with your Healing Mechadendrite, you can inject a
healthy dose of combat stimulants (no action required), giving the creature advantage
on any attack rolls it makes before the end of their next turn.

##### Superior Chirurgeon

Starting at 17th level, you can cast the _cybernetic resurrection_ tech power using this
feature. When resurrecting a creature this way, you can keep the creature the original
race it originally was, instead of turning them into a techfused. Once you cast this
power, you can’t do so again for 10 days.

Additionally, you can target up to 6 creatures within 30 feet of you to improve their
health. For 8 hours, you increase their maximum hit points and current hit points by an
amount equal to half your level. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you complete a long rest.

## Berserker

A tall human tribesman strides through blizzards, draped in fur and hefting his axe. He
laughs as he charges towards the group of orks that dared to attack his feral world’s


villages.
An ogryn snarls at the latest challenger to his authority, ready to break his
opponent’s neck with his bare hands, as he did the last six opponents.
Frothing from the mouth, a Blood Angel slams his gauntlet into the face of his dark
eldar foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another, splintering ribs
and fracturing bones.
These berserkers, different as they might be, are defined by an uncanny rage they
enter when the dawn of battle rises. More than a mere emotion, their anger and
ferocity is that of a cornered animal, yet their purpose is as clear as the eye of a storm.
For some, their rage springs from the communion of technology and flesh, using
cybernetics to quell any unnecessary emotions to fuel their fury in battle. For others,
this rage is forged from years of battle, discipline, and dedication to their cause.

#### Quick Build

You can make a berserker quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength
your highest ability modifier. Your next highest score should be Constitution and
Dexterity. Second, choose the mercenary background.

```
##### Unarmored Defense

While you are not wearing any armor, your armor class equals 10 + your Dexterity
modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

##### Rage

In battle, you fight with a primal fury. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus
action.

While in a rage, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:


```
⦁ You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
⦁ When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to
the damage roll. This bonus increases as you level.
⦁ You have resistance to energy and kinetic damage.
```
If you are able to cast powers, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while in a
rage.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn
ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage
since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have entered a rage the maximum number of times for your berserker level,
you must finish a long rest before you can enter a rage again. You may use rage 2 times
at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.

##### Danger Sense

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be,
giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on
Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and powers. To
gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

##### Reckless Attack

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce
desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack
recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using strength
during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

##### War Path

At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage, such as the Path of
Hatred. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th
levels.

##### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase
one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your
choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.


##### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the
Attack action on your turn.

##### Fast Movement

Starting at 5th level, your walking speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing
heavy armor.

##### Battle Instinct

By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated,
you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing
anything else on that turn.

##### Brutal Critical

Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when
determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

##### Relentless Rage

Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you
drop to 0 hit points while you're in a rage and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10
Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a
short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

##### Persistent Rage

Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall
unconscious or if you choose to end it.

##### Indomitable Might

Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength
score, you can use that score in place of the total.


##### Champion of War

At 20th level, you embody the power of war. Your Strength and Constitution scores
increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 26.

#### War Paths

#### Path of Hatred

The sharpest blade is dull compared to the purest hatred. Along this path, many have
fallen prey to the mindless rages that suits a life of war and conquest.

##### Unending Fury

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can channel your hatred into your
weapon strikes. While you're raging, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with
a weapon attack takes extra damage equal to 1d6 + half your berserker level. The extra
damage deals the same damage type as your weapon.

##### Rampager’s Dash

Also at 3rd level, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points on your turn, you can use a
bonus action to immediately move up to half your speed.

##### Mindless Rage

Beginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are
charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the
duration of the rage.

##### Furious Charge

Beginning at 10th level, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action while you are
raging.

##### Retaliation

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of
you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

#### Path of Augmentation


In order to become more powerful, you rely on the cybernetics that empower your
body. The flesh is weak, and you have used metal to overcome its weaknesses.

##### Utility Cybernetics

When you choose this path at 3rd level, you learn the tech powers _mending_ and
_analyze,_ and you can cast them without expending tech points. You can cast _analyze_ this
way a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one). You
regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

##### Dermal Armor

Also at 3rd level, you gain dermal armor that can harden under extreme stress, causing
your skin to have a metallic appearance. While you are raging, you have resistance to all
damage except psionic damage.

##### Support Cybernetics

At 6th level you gain a mechanical exoskeleton to further strengthen your body. Your
carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled and you have
advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.

Additionally, you can choose one of the following cybernetics below, and gain the
benefits of it:

```
⦁ Adaptable Hand Mesh. You gain a climbing and swimming speed equal to your
walking speed.
⦁ Holdout Cavity. You have a holdout cavity placed in one location on your body of
your choice, such as your arm or leg. This holdout cavity is a small compartment
inside of your body that can fully conceal items placed inside of it. A holdout
cavity can be used to store and hide a light weapon or item of similar size. It
takes an action to store or withdraw an item or weapon from your holdout
cavity.
⦁ Panspectral Optics. You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to
discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet
away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your
Wisdom (Perception) checks.
```
##### More Machine than Man

Starting at 10th level, your cybernetics allow you to become immune to poison and
nonenhanced disease. Additionally, you ignore nonenhanced difficult terrain.


##### Hydraulic Override

At 14th level, you gain the ability to thrust people into a prone position. While you're in
a rage, you can use a bonus action on your turn to knock a size Large or smaller creature
prone when you hit it with melee weapon attack.

## Courser

Exhausted but determined, a human stalks the alleyways of the hive city, hunting the
quarry he knows is behind the murders in the habblock. Clutching a pistol in both hands,
he steps into the alleyway full of mutants and gangers. Spinning around, he becomes a
hurricane of bullets, felling each enemy one after another.
After tumbling away from a shell’s explosion, a mutant finds her footing, only to fire
off two shots from her carbine at the oncoming horde of tyranids. Shrugging off the
waves of fear that dare to overturn the tumultuous tides of her mind, she steels herself,
releasing a cluster of grenades she had prepared, watching as the overgrown bugs turn
into crisp husks.
Glancing at his dataslate, a techfused looks through the eyes of his servo skull,
tracing the movements of a shadow from amongst the rooftops. He readies his sniper
shot, his artificial lungs not making the slightest of noise as he lines his shot.
Coursers are the first on the scene of the crime, and the last one to see their target.
Regardless of terrain, distance, or obstacles, a courser is most suited to tracking and
hunting, using tech powers and weaponry to overcome their endeavors.

#### Quick Build

You can make a courser quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or
Dexterity your highest ability modifier, depending on whether you want to focus on
melee combat or on ranged weapons (or finesse weapons). Your next highest score
should be Intelligence. Second, choose the mercenary background.

#### Class Features

As a courser, you have the following class features.

##### Hit Points

**Hit Dice** : 1d10 per courser level

##### Courser Training

Beginning at 1st level, you are difficult to pin down during a fight. You can move up to
half your speed as a reaction when an enemy ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This
movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

Additionally, choose one of the skills you are proficient in. You can add double your
proficiency bonus to checks made with that skill.

##### Target Lock

At 1st level, your unique technology allows you to track enemies and land hits with
deadly precision. As a bonus action, you can activate your target lock and gain the
following benefits:

```
⦁ Your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 damage of the same type as your
weapon.
⦁ You have advantage on Perception checks made to detect creatures.
⦁ Your attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.
```
Your target lock lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, or if you end it
early as a bonus action.

You can use this feature twice, and you can use it more often at higher levels, as shown
in the Target Lock column of the Courser table. You regain all expended uses when you
finish a long rest.

At 9th level, this damage increases to 1d8, and you can see invisible creatures within 30
feet of you while this feature is activated. At 17th level, the damage increases to 1d10,
and you can see through illusions, shapechangers, and into the immaterium to a range
of 30 feet while this feature is activated.

##### Fighting Style

Beginning at 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose
one of the Fighting Style options, listed below. You can’t take a Fighting Style option
more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

```
Blind Fighting. You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you
```

can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in
darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the
creature successfully hides from you.
**_Defense._** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
**_Dueling._** When you are wielding a weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you
gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
**_Great Weapon Fighting._** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you
make with a weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and
must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-
handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
**_Interception._** When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5
feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target
takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be
wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
**_Thrown Weapon Fighting._** You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as
part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged
attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
**_Two-Weapon Fighting._** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your
ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Furthermore, being within 5 feet of
a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with one-
handed weapons.
**_Unarmed Fighting._** Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6
+ your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren’t wielding any weapons or a shield when
you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8. At the start of each of your turns, you
can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.

##### Techcasting

By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use technology to cast tech
powers, like a savant does.

**_Tech Powers Known_**

You learn 7 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in
the Tech Powers Known column of the Courser table. You may not learn a tech power of
a level higher than your Max Power Level.

**_Tech Points_**

You have a number of tech points equal to your courser level x 2, as shown in the Tech
Points column of the Courser table. When you cast a power, you expend a number of
tech points equal to 1 + the power’s level. You regain all expended tech points when you
finish a long rest.


**_Max Power Level_**

Many tech powers can be overpowered, consuming more tech points to create a
greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at
higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Courser table.

You may only cast tech powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability
to do so after a long rest.

**_Techcasting Ability_**

Your techcasting ability is the ability score you use to cast tech powers. Your techcasting
ability is Intelligence. You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to
your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability score modifier when setting the
saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

```
Tech save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your techcasting modifier
Tech attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your techcasting modifier
```
##### Courser Technique

Also at 3rd level, you choose to focus on a specific courser technique, which is detailed
at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and
again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

##### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase
one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your
choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the
Attack action on your turn.

##### Wanderer’s Movement

At 6th level, your walking speed increases by 10, and you gain a climbing speed and a
swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

##### Tireless Pursuit

At 10th level, when you activate your target lock, you also gain an amount of temporary


hit points equal to your courser level.

Additionally, when you roll for a Survival check, if the result on the d20 is below your
courser level, you can treat the roll as being equal to your courser level instead. For
example, if a 13th-level courser rolls a 12 or lower on a Survival check, the courser can
treat that roll as a 13, and then add any additional modifiers on top of that.

##### Combat Cloak

At 14th level, you can choose to go invisible when you activate target lock. This
invisibility lasts until your target lock ends. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it
again until you complete a short or long rest.

##### Perfect Lock

At 18th level, your target lock damage die deals maximum damage, instead of rolling for
the amount.

##### Master Courser

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter. Once on each of your turns, you can
add your Intelligence modifier to the attack and damage roll of an attack you make.

#### Courser Techniques

#### Hunter Technique

The hunter technique is utilized by coursers that desire to know the weaknesses of their
prey, while also being able to defend against their prey’s attacks, or to slay their minions
quickly.

##### Hunter’s Insight

When you choose this technique at 3rd level, when you attack and deal damage to a
creature while your target lock is active, you can learn if the creature has any damage
immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities, and you learn what they are.

##### Pinpoint Weakness

Also starting at 3rd level, if an allied creature is within 5 feet of a hostile creature and
isn’t incapacitated, you have advantage on the first attack roll you make on your turn
against the hostile creature.


##### Reflexive Defense

Starting at 7th level, when you are hit by an attack or fail a saving throw, but before any
effects take place, you can use your reaction to gain a bonus to your AC or the saving
throw equal to your proficiency bonus, potentially causing the attack to miss or the
saving throw to succeed.

##### Cleave the Tide

Starting at 11th level, you have learned to cleave the tide of enemies that stand against
you. You can use your action to make melee attacks against any number of creatures
within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.

Alternatively, you can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of
creatures in a 10-foot square within your weapon’s range. You must make a separate
attack roll for each target.

##### Evasion

At 15th level, when you are subjected to an effect, such as a psyker’s _ice storm_ or a
savant’s _fireball_ , that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half
damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half
damage if you fail.

#### Stalker Technique

The stalker technique focuses on stealth and exploiting the weaknesses of their prey,
until they finally find the moment to bring them down.

##### Ambush Augments

At 3rd level, you can take the Hide action as part of the bonus action you use to activate
your target lock. While target lock is active, you can take the Hide action as a bonus
action on each of your turns.

##### Precision Strike

Also starting at 3rd level, when you deal damage to a creature with a weapon attack,
you can make a precision strike against the target. The creature suffers one of the
following effects:

```
⦁ Until the start of your next turn, the creature’s movement is 0.
```

```
⦁ You can cause the next attack roll the creature makes within 1 minute to be at
disadvantage.
⦁ You can cause the creature to have disadvantage on the next Strength, Dexterity,
or Constitution saving throw it makes within 1 minute.
```
You have a number of precision strikes equal to double your proficiency bonus, and you
regain all uses at the end of a long rest.

##### Quick Pounce

At 7th level, while your target lock is activated, you can take the Dash action as a bonus
action on your turn. If you dash in this way, you do not provoke opportunity attacks until
the beginning of your next turn.

##### Predict Assault

At 11th level, when you are attacked, you can roll the damage die of your target lock
and reduce the attack roll by that amount. You can use this feature once per turn.

##### Critical Targeting

At 15th level, while your target lock is active, your weapon attacks deal critical strikes on
a roll of 19 or 20.

## Crusader

Amongst the warring armies, a few voices are heard above the shelling artillery and
exploding bolt rounds. These voices ring true, inspiring the people around them,
uplifting even the common man to a warrior of vengeance to strike down the enemies
that surround them. Crusaders inspire those around them to perform courageous acts,
bolster themselves against oncoming hordes of foes, and deliver righteous retribution
upon those who dare to put themselves in opposition to their cause. In times of dire
need, a crusader may even implore their god or deity for aid, sending down an angel or
daemon of great power to serve them, or manifesting a miracle into existence.

#### Quick Build

You can make a crusader quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or
Dexterity your highest ability modifier, depending if you want to focus on melee or
ranged combat (or finesse weapons). Your next highest score should be Constitution.
Second, choose the acolyte background.


#### Class Features

As a crusader, you gain the following class features.

##### Hit Points

**Hit Dice** : 1d10 per crusader level
**Hit Points at 1st Level** : 10 + your Constitution modifier

##### Fighting Style

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose a Fighting Style from
the list of optional features. You can't take the same Fighting Style option more than
once, even if you get to choose again.

**_Blind Fighting._** You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you
can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in
darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the
creature successfully hides from you.
**_Defense._** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
**_Dueling._** When you are wielding a weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you
gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
**_Great Weapon Fighting._** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you
make with a weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and
must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-
handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
**_Interception._** When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5
feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target
takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be
wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
**_Thrown Weapon Fighting._** You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as
part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged
attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
**_Two-Weapon Fighting._** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your
ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Furthermore, being within 5 feet of


a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with one-
handed weapons.
**_Unarmed Fighting._** Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6
+ your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren’t wielding any weapons or a shield when
you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8. At the start of each of your turns, you
can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.

##### Vengeful Strike

You can make allies strike, even when it is not their turn. As a bonus action, you can
allow an allied creature within 60 feet of you that can hear you to make one weapon
attack using their reaction.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you
regain all expended uses at the end of a short or long rest.

##### Valor

Beginning at 2nd level, you can inspire others through stirring words or rallying cries.
Your valor is represented by a number of valor points. Your crusader level determines
the number of points you have, as shown in the Valor Points column of the Crusader
table.

You can spend these points to use certain features. When you make an attack against a
hostile creature or when you use your vengeful strike feature, you can spend a valor
point and roll a valor die, a d6, to achieve one of the following effects:

```
⦁ One creature within 60 feet of you gains hit points equal to one roll of your valor
die.
⦁ When you or an allied creature deal damage with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal additional damage equal to one roll of your valor die.
⦁ You or an allied creature within 60 feet of you gain a bonus to their AC against
the next attack that targets them equal to one roll of the valor die. This bonus to
AC lasts until the start of your next turn.
```
You regain any expended uses of valor when you finish a short or long rest.

Your Valor die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8
at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

##### Faithful Rest


At 2nd level, you can use oration to help your allies recover during a short rest. If you or
any friendly creatures who can hear your performance spend one or more Hit Dice to
regain hit points at the end of a short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra
amount of hit points equal to one roll of your valor die.

##### Crusader Oath

Starting at 3rd level, you take the crusader oath that binds you to service. This oath is
something that each crusader takes personally, sometimes in front of a cleric or
professor of their faith, and personally interprets based on their own beliefs, ethics, and
experiences. You gain features for this oath at 3rd, 7th, and 14th level.

##### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase
one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your
choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the
Attack action on your turn.

##### Battle Cry

At 6th level, you gain the ability to shrug off mind-influencing effects for yourself and
your teammates. As a bonus action, you can start a chant, mantra, or speech that lasts
for 1 minute. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 60 feet of you have
advantage on saving throws against being frightened and charmed. A creature must be
able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are
incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

At 11th level, you and any friendly creatures within 60 feet of you have immunity to
being frightened and charmed when you use this feature..

##### Last Stand

Beginning at 9th level, your resolve causes you and your allies to keep going. When you
or an allied creature within 60 feet of you that can see you is reduced to 0 hit points but
not killed outright, you can use your reaction to cause that creature to drop to 1 hit
point instead, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.


You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times
between long rests starting at 17th level.

##### Divine Intervention

Beginning at 10th level, you can call on a miracle to intervene on your behalf when your
need is great.

Imploring for a miracle requires your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll
percentile dice, a d100. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your crusader level,
your miracle manifests into reality. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the
effect of any psychic power would be appropriate, or the summoning of a daemon or
saint temporarily to fight alongside you. If your miracle manifests into reality, you can't
use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long
rest.

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

##### Closed Mind

Starting at 17th level, your mind is set in its path to see through any deception. You
automatically succeed on saving throws against illusions, having your thoughts read, and
your mood altered. Additionally, you have immunity to psionic damage.

##### Duty Unto Death

At 18th level, you and allied creatures without 60 feet of you that can hear you are
always under the effects of your battle cry feature. This effect is suspended if you are
incapacitated or silenced.

Additionally, at the end of a long rest, you can choose up to ten creatures within 60 feet
of you that can hear you, and give them a rousing speech. Their maximum and current
hit points increase by an amount equal to your crusader level. This benefit lasts for 8
hours, or until you die.

#### Crusader Oaths

Each crusader takes an oath, and up until this point, they might have viewed their
journey up until this point merely training for what is to come. A crusader oath is what
binds them to service of their cause, but many crusaders have their own vision of what
their oath means, and what it means to break their oath. If an oath is broken, a crusader
may decide to take another oath, or to seek penitence or forgiveness by a priest or
professor of their faith or creed.


Your Crusader Oath gives you features at 3rd level, 7th level, and 14th level.

#### Oath of the Apostle

Apostles are holy men of their faith, and seek out to do righteousness for their just
cause. These apostles are often studious of their religious materials, and seek to instill
fanaticism and zealotry within the ranks of their allies. Although each oath differs in
severity and interpretation, the tenets an Oath of the Apostle might take look similar to
this:

**_Shepherd of the Flock._** As I was once a sheep, I am now a shepherd, and I herd my
followers into enlightenment.
**_Sacred Texts._** The sacred texts show us wisdom and truth. It is up to us to divine
their meaning.
**_War of the Word._** To win the hearts of the people, your words must show them the
truth.

##### War Scholar

Beginning at 3rd level when you choose this oath, you are well-learned in the art of war
and philosophy. Choose two of the following skills: Insight, Investigation, Lore, Nature,
and Occult. You gain proficiency in these skills, and you can add double your proficiency
bonus to skill checks made when using these skills.

##### Fanaticism

Starting at 3rd level, you can inspire allies to fight beyond their limit. When you use your
vengeful strike feature, the creature gains 5 temporary hit points. When it gains these
temporary hit points, it can immediately move up to half of its speed, without provoking
opportunity attacks, before or after taking its attack.

The number of temporary hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this
class, increasing to 8 at 5th level, 11 at 10th level, and 14 at 15th level.

##### Sacred Word

Starting at 7th level, you can treat any roll on the d20 of 9 or lower as a 10 when making
Intimidation, Persuasion and Performance checks.

##### Summon Champion of Faith

Starting at 14th level, you can use an action to summon an otherworldly champion of


your faith for 1 minute to an unoccupied spot within 30 feet of you. This champion uses
the statistics provided below, and obeys any verbal command you issue it. The
champion acts on your initiative. If you are incapacitated or did not issue it orders, the
champion will defend you and itself to the best of its ability.

Once you summon a champion of faith, you can’t do so again until you complete a long
rest.

### Champion of Faith

```
#### Oath of the Penitent

The penitent are those who have strayed from the path of righteousness, or have erred
in some way. Some penitent know that they can never return, and wish to live their lives
on the outskirts. Other penitent choose to instead look at this as climbing their way back
to holiness. Many who sear themselves to the Oath of the Penitent cast away their
armor and clothes, wearing only a thin cloth as punishment. Although each oath differs
in severity and interpretation, the tenets an Oath of the Penitent might take look similar
to this:

**_Let Not Weakness Define._** Weakness has led me to this path, but strength is my
absolution.
**_Redemption Requires Sacrifice._** If I am to redeem myself, I must be willing to
sacrifice everything.


**_Not All Who Wander Are Lost._** Although it is a winding road I wander, I am never
lost in my pursuit of redemption.

##### Unarmored Defense

Starting at 3rd level when you choose this oath, while you are not wearing armor, your
AC is 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier.

##### Repentant Fervor

Also at 3rd level, whenever you spend one or more valor points, you have advantage on
the first weapon attack you make before the end of your next turn. Alternatively, you
can allow an allied creature to gain advantage on the next attack roll they make using
your vengeful strike feature.

##### Devastating Critical

At 7th level, when you score a critical hit with a weapon attack, you deal an additional
amount of damage equal to your level in this class.

##### Redeemer

Starting at 14th level, when you are below half of your maximum hit points, you have
resistance to energy and kinetic damage.

## Exorcist

Clad in heavy armor, a space marine sends out a sheet of warp flame, incinerating his
enemies. An eldar clashes against daemons, before sending them back screaming into
the warp. The inquisitor places his brand against the daemonhost’s back, screaming out
litanies of fury and the Emperor, coaxing the daemon out, its twisted body forcibly
pulled from the body of its vessel.
Exorcists are the frontline of defense between that which lies beyond the veil of
reality. Exorcists protect reality from these horrors, but can have very different ideals
and ways to accomplish this. Some exorcists might believe that a daemon must be
purged at all costs, and is willing to commit grand atrocities if it means destroying the
greater evil, while more radical exorcists might create pacts with daemons to gain their
powers, in order to banish even more from realspace.

#### Quick Build

You can make an exorcist quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength


your highest ability modifier. Your next highest score should be Charisma or
Constitution. Second, choose the witchhunter background.

#### Class Features

As an exorcist, you gain the following class features.

##### Hit Points

**Hit Dice** : 1d10 per exorcist level
**Hit Points at 1st Level** : 10 + your Constitution modifier
**Hit Points at Higher Levels** : 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per exorcist level
after 1st

**Starting Proficiencies**

##### Psycasting

You have channeled the ability to channel the immaterium to fuel your psychic powers.
See chapter 10 for the general rules of casting powers and chapter 11 for the psychic
powers list.

**_Psychic Powers Known_**

You learn 5 psychic powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as
shown in the Psychic Powers Known column of the Exorcist table. You may not learn a
psychic power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.

**_Psyker Points_**

You have a number of psyker points equal to your exorcist level x 2, as shown in the
Psyker Points column of the Exorcist table. When you cast a power, you expend a
number of psyker points equal to 1 + the power’s level. You regain all expended psyker
points when you finish a long rest.

**_Max Power Level_**

Many psychic powers can be overpowered, consuming more psyker points to create a
greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at
higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Exorcist table.


You may only cast psychic powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the
ability to do so after a long rest.

**_Psycasting Ability_**

Your psycasting ability is the ability score you use to cast psychic powers. Your
psycasting ability can be either Wisdom or Charisma (your choice). You use this ability
score modifier whenever a power refers to your psycasting ability. Additionally, you use
this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psychic power you cast
and when making an attack roll with one.

```
Psychic save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your psycasting modifier
Psychic attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your psycasting modifier
```
##### Manifest Immaterium

You can manifest your warp energies into two different effects: Revitalize and Warp
Flame. You have a pool of energy that can be used to fuel these effects, and the pool
replenishes when you take a long rest. You have a number of points in the pool equal to
your exorcist level x 5.

**_Warp Flame._** As an action, you can choose a point within 60 feet of you and draw power
from the pool to summon warp flames that deal damage up to the maximum amount
remaining in your pool. Each creature in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on that point
must make a Dexterity saving throw against your psychic save DC. Each creature within
that radius takes necrotic damage equal to the amount of points spent from your pool
on a failed save, and half as much on a successful save.

**_Revitalize._** As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to
restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining
in your pool. Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure
the target of one disease, or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple
diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of revitalize, expending points
separately for each one. This feature has no effect on undead and constructs. This
feature can cure all diseases, including enhanced diseases, such as Nurgle’s Rot.

##### Witch Sight

You can detect the presence of warp creatures and psykers in your vicinity. As an action,
you can open your awareness to detect such otherworldly beings. Until the end of your
next turn, you know the location of any daemon or undead within 60 feet of you that is
not behind total cover. You know the type (such as daemon or undead) of any being


whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the Daemon Primarch Angron, for
instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any creatures that
possess the psycasting feature.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your proficiency bonus. When
you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

##### Fighting Style

At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following
options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to
choose again.

**_Blind Fighting._** You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you
can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in
darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the
creature successfully hides from you.
**_Defense._** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
**_Dueling._** When you are wielding a weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you
gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
**_Great Weapon Fighting._** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you
make with a weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and
must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-
handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
**_Interception._** When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5
feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target
takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be
wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
**_Thrown Weapon Fighting._** You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as
part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged
attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
**_Two-Weapon Fighting._** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your
ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Furthermore, being within 5 feet of
a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with one-
handed weapons.

##### Warp Strike

Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can
expend psyker points to deal additional damage to the target, and you can choose for
this additional damage to be either necrotic or radiant damage. The additional damage
is 1d8 for each point spent in this way. You can’t deal more additional damage than the


amount shown in the Warp Strike column of the Exorcist table.

The damage increases by 1d8 if the creature hit is a daemon or undead.

##### Exorcist Order

When you reach 3rd level, you begin the rite of passage to enter an order of exorcists,
and gain special features and abilities based on which order you choose, such as the
Order of Subjugation and the Order of Seers. Choose one of the options for your
exorcist order at the end of the class description.

##### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase
one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your
choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the
Attack action on your turn.

##### Ritual of Purification

Starting at 5th level, you’ve studied how to exorcise creatures with a purifying rite. Over
the course of 10 minutes, you can psychically ward a 10-foot-diameter circle. When a
creature enters the circle, you can use your action to touch the creature and end any
effect causing the creature to be charmed, frightened, poisoned, possessed, and cure
the creature of all diseases. If the creature is willing, the effect ends immediately. If the
creature is not willing, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your psychic
save DC, ending any of the listed effects on a failure. This ritual can purify all diseases,
including enhanced diseases, such as Nurgle’s Rot.

This feature can only end effects that are caused by a power level equal to half your
exorcist level or lower. The circle becomes inactive after 8 hours, when you create
another circle using this feature, or when you use your bonus action to deactivate the
circle. If a creature is unwilling and succeeds on the saving throw against this feature, it
becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours.

Additionally, you have learned to sanctify your body against impure effects. You have
advantage on saving throws against being possessed and against all diseases.

##### Aura of Protection


Starting at 6th level, you project a psychic aura to protect yourself or allies. Whenever
you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature
gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your psycasting modifier (with a minimum
bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

##### Aura of Courage

Starting at 10th level, your aura instills confidence in your allies. You and friendly
creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

##### Improved Warp Strike

By 11th level, you are so suffused with warp energy that all your melee weapon strikes
carry psychic power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the
creature takes an extra 1d8 necrotic or radiant damage (your choice). If you also use
your Warp Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Warp
Smite.

##### Cleansing Touch

Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one power on yourself or on one
willing creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your psycasting modifier (a
minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Exorcist Order

Becoming an exorcist involves completing a special rite that finally indoctrinates you
into an order, and allows you to pursue a specialization within the field of exorcism.

#### Order of Subjugation

The Order of Subjugation was created for those who walk one of the most difficult
paths: containing and controlling the creatures from beyond the veil. These exorcists
often border on the radical side, sometimes being tempted to converse and even make
pacts with the creatures that bargain for their freedom.


##### Chains of Binding

Starting at 3rd level, you can summon psychic chains to bind creatures. As a bonus
action, you can target a creature size Huge or smaller within 30 feet of you and attempt
to summon chains to bind them. The creature makes a Strength saving throw against
your psychic save DC. On a failure, the creature becomes restrained. As an action, the
chained creature can attempt a Strength saving throw, ending this effect on a success.

The chains disappear after 1 minute, if the creature succeeds against the saving throw, if
you become incapacitated, or until you end this effect early (no action required). You
can only have one creature chained at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you
regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

##### Aura of Supremacy

Starting at 7th level, you and allied creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be charmed or
possessed while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

##### Searing Chains

Starting at 15th level, creatures that are restrained by your Chains of Binding take
damage at the start of their turn equal to 2d8 + your psycasting modifier. You can
choose if this damage is radiant or necrotic.

Additionally, while a creature is under the effect of your Chains of Binding, it has
disadvantage on the first saving throw to resist being banished.

##### Warden’s Avatar

Starting at 20th level, you can psychically project yourself into the avatar of the warden,
the subjugator of daemons. You gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

```
⦁ Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws and skill checks to resist and
remove your Chains of Binding.
⦁ You have resistance to all damage.
⦁ Whenever a creature damages you, it takes radiant or necrotic damage (your
choice) equal to half of the amount it dealt you.
```

#### Order of Seers

The Order of Seers are for those who use their psychic abilities to see into the world
around them and detect the weakening veil between realspace and the warp.

##### Seer’s Vision

Starting at 3rd level, when you use your witch sight, you can also detect the presence of
any illusions and powers used to hide or conceal something’s true form or nature.
Additionally, your witch sight can also detect the presence of any planar portals to the
immaterium.

##### Blessing of True Strike

Also starting at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to bless your weapon with psychic
energies. For 1 minute, you add your psycasting ability modifier to attack rolls made
with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon becomes enhanced, if it
wasn’t already. Additionally, dealing damage with this weapon to shapechangers or
creatures under the effect of an illusion causes them to make a Charisma saving throw
against your psychic save DC. On a failure, the creature reveals its true form, and any
illusions on the creature are dispelled.

You can end this effect on your turn (no action required). If you are no longer holding or
carrying this weapon, or if you become incapacitated, this effect ends. You can only
have one weapon blessed using this feature at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain
all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

##### Aura of Foresight

Starting at 7th level, your aura of foresight allows your allies to act quickly in response
to danger. Allied creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be surprised, and they can add
your Psycasting modifier to their initiative rolls. These benefits last until you are
incapacitated.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

##### Guide

Starting at 15th level, you can glimpse into the future, aiding an ally. As an action, you
can target yourself or one allied creature within 30 feet of you with this ability. Attack


rolls against this creature have disadvantage for 10 minutes.

##### Immaculate Form

Starting at 20th level, you can assume a form that can see through even the most potent
of lies. As an action, you can gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

```
⦁ You gain truesight out to 120 feet, and you know when you hear a lie.
⦁ You can cast exorcist powers that have a casting time of 1 action as a bonus
action.
⦁ You have advantage on attack rolls against all daemons.
```
## Mechnician

An ork mekboy steps forward, his body a twisted fusion of rusted metal and green skin,
before unleashing an unstable bomb towards a horde of guardsmen, turning their
bodies to ash. A tech priest looks towards the oncoming Tau fire warriors, and quickly
reveals a sphere. As he turns its dials and whispers an incantation in binary, the fire
warriors become burdened with the weight of gravity, until it crushes them and seals
them within their armor as coffins.

Mechnicians use technology as the core of their power, and then utilize its benefits in
unique ways, mastering it until they perform superhuman feats of power with its
effects.

#### Quick Build

You can make a mechnician quickly by following these suggestions. First, make
Intelligence your highest ability modifier. Your next highest score should be Dexterity or
Constitution. Second, choose the mechanic background.

#### Class Features

As a mechnician, you gain the following class features.

##### Hit Points

**Hit Dice** : 1d8 per mechnician level
**Hit Points at 1st Level** : 8 + your Constitution modifier
**Hit Points at Higher Levels** : 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per mechnician level
after 1st


**Starting Proficiencies**
You are proficient with the following items, in addition to any proficiencies provided by
your race or background.

##### Critical Analysis

You can use your tactical skills to help allies on the battlefield and off. To do so, you use
a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of
you who can hear you. That creature gains one Critical Analysis die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number
rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait
until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Critical Analysis die, but must
decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Critical Analysis
die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Critical Analysis die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a
minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Your Critical Analysis die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die
becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

##### Techcasting

Beginning at 1st level, you have learned to use technology to cast tech powers.

**_Tech Powers Known_**

You learn 9 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in
the Tech Powers Known column of the Mechnician table. You may not learn a tech
power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.

**_Tech Points_**

You have a number of tech points equal to your mechnician level x 4, as shown in the
Tech Points column of the Mechnician table. When you cast a power, you expend a
number of tech points equal to 1 + the power’s level. You regain all expended tech
points when you finish a long rest.

**_Max Power Level_**

Many tech powers can be overpowered, consuming more tech points to create a


greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at
higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Mechnician table.

You may only cast tech powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability
to do so after a long rest.

**_Techcasting Ability_**

Your techcasting ability is the ability score you use to cast tech powers. Your techcasting
ability is Intelligence. You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to
your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability score modifier when setting the
saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

```
Tech save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your techcasting modifier
Tech attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your techcasting modifier
```
##### Cybernetic Modifications

Starting at 2nd level, you’ve learned to make modifications to your body, cybernetically
augmenting yourself. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify yourself with
cybernetic augmentations.

You have 2 modification slots, and you gain more at higher levels, as shown in the
Cybernetic Modifications column of the Mechnician table. Over the course of a long
rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your
Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). The list of cybernetic modifications is listed at
the end of the class.

Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this
class, the DC equals your tech save DC.

##### Infuse Item

Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to temporarily enhance a weapon or armor by
maintaining it regularly. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonenhanced
object that is a suit of armor, a shield, or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of
your next long rest, the object becomes an enhanced item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if
it’s armor or a shield or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it’s a weapon.

Once you’ve used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 13th level.


##### Mechnician School

At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a mechnician school of your
choice. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.

##### Expertise

At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for
any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.

##### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase
one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your
choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##### Analytical Cogitators

Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Critical
Analysis when you finish a short or long rest.

##### Perfect Infusion

At 18th level, weapons you infuse score a critical strike on a roll of 19 or 20.
Alternatively, if you infuse armor, any critical hits made against it become normal hits.

##### Superior Analysis

At 20th level, you can spend one use of your Critical Analysis to give up to five allied
creatures within 30 feet of you a Critical Analysis die.

#### Mechnician Schools

Mechnicians are taught in specific schools that teach them to make and manipulate
technology. Although you may have never attended such a school, you can still adopt
the features of that school to use.

#### School of Infiltration

The school of infiltration gives its students the capabilities of stealth and manipulation,
churning out practiced spies and assassins.


##### Enable Stealth

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to touch a willing creature other than
yourself to give it advantage on Stealth checks. This benefit lasts for 1 hour or until you
use this feature again.

##### Self Hologram

Starting at 6th level, you can use holograms to create an illusory duplicate of yourself.

As a bonus action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or
until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a power). The illusion
appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. When you first
create this illusion and as a bonus action on each of your turns, you can move the
illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.

For the duration, you can cast powers as though you were in the illusion's space, but
you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within
5 feet of a hostile creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls
against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

##### Polygram

Starting at 14th level, you can create up to four duplicates of yourself, instead of one,
when you use self hologram. When you first create these illusions and as a bonus action
on your turn, you can move any number of them up to 30 feet, to a maximum range of
120 feet.

Additionally, if one of your illusions and an allied creature are within 5 feet of a hostile
creature that can see the illusion, that allied creature has advantage on attack rolls
against the hostile creature.

#### School of Chronomancy

Few are ever allowed to see the school of chronomancy and all of the dangers that
reside within its infinite books, tomes, and data-sheets on its ever-confounding nature.
Those who dabble in technology and research regarding time and its uses via technology
are few and far in-between, and are mostly found amongst the elusive eldar and the
immortal necron.


##### Time Shift

Starting at 3rd level when you choose this school, you have learned how to use
technology to shift your position in time. You can add your Intelligence modifier to your
initiative rolls.

##### Future Glimpse

Beginning at 3rd level when you choose this school, you have the unique ability to use
technology to peer into the future and prepare for it. When you finish a long rest, roll
two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw,
or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling
rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way
only once per turn.

Each future glimpse roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any
unused future glimpse rolls.

##### Stasis Field

Starting at 6th level, as a reaction to being targeted by an attack, you can cause a Large
or smaller creature attacking you that you can see to make a Constitution saving throw
against your tech save DC. On a failure, the creature is encased in a field of enhanced
energy until the end of your next turn, or until the creature takes any damage. While
encased in this way, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain
all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

##### Clearer Glimpse

Starting at 14th level, the visions you see intensify and paint a more accurate picture in
your mind of what is to come. You roll three d20s for your future glimpse feature, rather
than two.

#### Cybernetic Modifications

##### Optical Recorder

This augmentation replaces at least one of your eyes.

You are immune to the blinded condition, and you can enable or disable your ability to


see anytime. Additionally, your eyes are equipped with a pict recorder. You can
perfectly recall anything you’ve seen in the last 30 days.

##### Advanced Arm Augments

This augmentation replaces an arm.

When you make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw using Strength using only
this arm, your Strength score is treated as 15. When you make an ability check, attack
roll, or saving throw using Strength using more than just this arm, you take the average
of the arm’s Strength score and your own.

You can choose this modification multiple times.

##### Advanced Leg Augments

This augmentation replaces both legs.

When determining your bonus to AC and saving throws from Dexterity, your Dexterity
score is treated as 15. If your Dexterity score is already equal to or greater than 15, it
has no effect on you.

Additionally, you can substitute this score for your own whenever you make an ability
check or attack roll that uses your legs.

##### Detachable Eye

This augmentation replaces an eye.

As an action, you can remove or replace this eye. While removed, the eye sprouts eight
small legs, has a speed of 15 feet, an AC of 10, and 1 hit point. If it dies, you can’t use it
again until you complete a long rest. As an action on each of your turns, you can move
the eye up to its speed as long as it is within 30 feet of you. You can see through both
the detached eye and your remaining eye at the same time, or you can use your action
to see through only one eye or the other.

You can choose this modification multiple times.

##### Harpoon Hand

This augmentation replaces a hand.

You modify your hand, granting it the ability to transform into a harpoon. With this


hand, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60. On a hit, it deals 1d6
kinetic damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.

A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the harpoon. As an action, a creature can
attempt to remove the harpoon. Removing the harpoon requires an Athletics check.
While the harpoon is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot
cable.

While the harpoon is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel,
pulling yourself to the location if the target is larger than you. A creature or object your
size or smaller is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action
required).

Once you’ve used this feature, you can’t use your hand again until you recover and
reinsert it as an action.

You can choose this modification multiple times.

##### Subdermal Armor

When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC becomes 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

##### Mechadendrite Arm

You create a mechanical arm which mounts to your shoulder, which you can use
independently. This arm can wield weapons and shields, and manipulate items and
objects as well as you can.

You can choose this modification twice.

## Psyker

The Imperial psyker stands beside the commissar, until given the signal. As he stretches
his hands outward, electricity crackles all over his body, culminating at his fingertips,
and decimates the enemies before him with the power of the warp. An eldar lays his
hands upon his fallen allies, causing restiching their wounds and bringing them back into
fighting condition. An electro priest calls forth the power of the machines, causing
electricity to surge forward and surround his enemies as they scream in pain.
Psykers manifest the power of the warp to fuel their effects, each in a variety of
ways. Psykers each have their own unique discipline that they can train themselves in,
and can even develop totally unique ways to manifest their abilities.


#### Quick Build

You can make a psyker quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Wisdom or
Charisma your highest ability modifier. Your next highest score should be Dexterity or
Constitution. Second, choose the scholar background.

##### Psycasting

You have manifested the ability to channel the immaterium to fuel your psychic powers.
See chapter 10 for the general rules of casting powers and chapter 11 for the psychic
powers list.

**_Psychic Powers Known_**

You learn 9 psychic powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as
shown in the Psychic Powers Known column of the Psyker table. You may not learn a
psychic power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.

**_Psyker Points_**

You have a number of psyker points equal to your psyker level x 4, as shown in the
Psyker Points column of the Psyker table. When you cast a power, you expend a number
of psyker points equal to 1 + the power’s level.. You regain all expended psyker points
when you finish a long rest.


**_Max Power Level_**

Many psychic powers can be overpowered, consuming more psyker points to create a
greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at
higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Psyker table.

You may only cast psychic powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the
ability to do so after a long rest.

**_Psycasting Ability_**

Your psycasting ability is the ability score you use to cast psychic powers. Your
psycasting ability can be either Wisdom or Charisma (your choice). You use this ability
score modifier whenever a power refers to your psycasting ability. Additionally, you use
this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psychic power you cast
and when making an attack roll with one.

```
Psychic save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your psycasting modifier
Psychic attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your psycasting modifier
```
##### Power Recovery

Starting at 1st level, you have learned to regain some of your energy by briefly
meditating. When you finish a short rest, you can regain a number of psyker points
equal to half your psyker level (rounded down) + your psycasting modifier. Once you’ve
used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

##### Warp-Empowered Casting

Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to manipulate the warp to fit your needs.
When you cast a psychic power, you can expend additional psyker points to modify the
power. You gain three of the following Warp-Empowered Casting options of your
choice. You gain another one at 9th and 17th level.

You can use only one Warp-Empowered Casting option on a power when you cast it,
unless otherwise noted.

**_Careful Power._** When you cast a power that forces other creatures to make a saving
throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the power’s full force. To do so,
you spend 1 psyker point and choose a number of those creatures up to your psycasting
modifier modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds
on its saving throw against the power.
**_Distant Power._** When you cast a power that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can


spend 1 additional psyker point to double the range of the power. When you cast a
power that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 additional psyker point to make the
range of the power 30 feet.
**_Extended Power._** When you cast a power that has a duration of 1 minute or longer,
you can spend 1 psyker point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24
hours.
**_Heightened Power._** When you cast a power that forces a creature to make a saving
throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 psyker points to give one target of the power
disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the power.
**_Improved Power._** When you roll damage for a power, you can spend 1 additional
psyker point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your psycasting modifier
(minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. You can use Improved Power even if you
have already used a different Warp-Empowered Casting option during the casting of the
power.
**_Quickened Power._** When you cast a power that has a casting time of 1 action, you
can spend 2 psyker points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.
**_Seeking Power._** If you miss with a psychic power that calls for an attack roll, you can
spend 2 psyker points to reroll the attack. You must use the new roll. You can use
Seeking Power even if you have already used a different Force-Empowered Casting
option during the casting of the power.
**_Twinned Power._** When you cast a power that targets only one creature and doesn’t
have a range of self, you can spend a number of psyker points equal to the power’s level
to target a second creature in range with the same power (1 psyker point if it is an at-
will power). To be eligible, a power must be incapable of targeting more than one
creature at the power’s current level. For example, _scorching ray_ aren’t eligible, but _ray
of frost_ is.

##### Telekinetic Barrier

Starting at 2nd level, you can summon a telekinetic barrier of psychic energy to repel
attacks. When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to create a barrier of
psychic energy. Until the start of your next turn, you have a bonus to AC equal to your
psycasting modifier (minimum of +1). This includes the triggering attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in
the Psyker table. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

##### Psychic Discipline

Starting at 3rd level, you begin specialized training on a psychic discipline of your choice.

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 3rd level and again at 6th, 14th,
and 18th level.


##### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase
one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your
choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##### Psychic Mastery

At 20th level, your attunement to the immaterium has become absolute. You gain
mastery over two psychic powers, and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-
level psychic powers that you know as your mastered powers. You can cast each of
these powers once as 3rd-level powers without expending psyker points. Once you cast
a mastered power in this way, you can’t cast that power again until you complete a
short or long rest.

If you want to cast it at a higher level, you must expend psyker points as normal.

#### Psychic Disciplines

After amounting enough power, a psyker may dedicate themselves to psychic discipline
to hone their strengths. These disciplines define a psyker’s main strengths, and may
even be able to be used to gain favor with certain factions.

#### Biomancy

The discipline of biomancy focuses on the body, and using psychic powers to influence
the physical attributes of one’s body.

##### Puppet Body

At 3rd level when you choose this discipline, you can control the flow of blood and
muscles in a creature. As a bonus action, you target a Large or smaller creature that has
blood or muscles within 60 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Constitution
saving throw against your psychic save DC or immediately move up to half of their
movement in any direction of your choice and make a single weapon attack against a
creature of your choice within range. Dead or unconscious creatures automatically fail
their saving throw.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you
regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


##### Psychic Stitches

Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to stitch wounds back together. When you cast
a psychic power that restores hit points, you can re-roll any results of 1 or 2 on the die,
accepting the new roll.

##### Crystallize Blood

At 6th level, you can cause blood to crystallize as it leaves the wound, dealing damage to
its attacker. As a reaction to a creature that has blood within 30 feet of you taking
damage, you can cause the attacker to take piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your
psycasting modifier.

At 14th level, this deals an additional 2d6 piercing damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your psycasting modifier, and you
regain all expended uses at the end of a long rest.

##### Burst Veins

At 17th level, as an action, you can emit a powerful aura that extends 30 feet out from
you. This aura pulses necrotic energy through the veins of nearby foes, causing them to
burst and bleed.

For 1 minute, any hostile creatures with blood that begin their turn within the aura or
enter it for the first time on their turn immediately suffer 2d6 necrotic damage. Any
hostile creature with blood that would regain hit points while within the aura only
regains half of the intended number of hit points.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Technomancy

The art of technomancy is followed by the psykers with the Cult of the Mechanicum,
otherwise known as electro priests. Other psykers who practice technomancy are often
found working closely alongside technology, and even the Dark Mechanicum has their
versions of electro priests. Those who follow this art have the ability to manipulate
machinery with their psychic ability.

##### One With Electricity

Starting at 3rd level when you choose this discipline, you gain resistance to lightning


damage.

##### Haywire Pulse

Also at 3rd level, you gain the ability to psychically render electronic devices inoperable.
As an action, you can target one electronic device within range that is not an artifact,
causing the device to shut down.. If the device is being held or operated by a creature,
the creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw to stop the device from being
shut down. Until the end of your next turn, the device can’t start or be restarted while
the targeted device is within range.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you
regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

##### Wire Travel

At 6th level, you gain the ability to psychically travel short distances over electric wires
such as data lines, power cables, and telephone wires. As a bonus action, you can touch
a device or outlet connected to a hardwired network and teleport along this network to
another device or outlet within your line of sight, up to a maximum distance of one mile
away, ending up in the nearest unoccupied space near the targeted location.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

##### Sense Network

At 14th level, when you touch an electronic device, wire, or outlet, you can psychically
sense up to a range of 300 feet all the hardwired connections the device has made to it.
This allows you to know the specific location and direction of all hardwired connections,
but not necessarily what it is connected to, nor what is in the location it is connected to.
For example, you can detect that a computer is connected to an outlet going 100 feet to
the north-west, but not that the room 100 feet to the north-west is a surveillance room.

Additionally, your Wire Travel can teleport you and up to five creatures of your choice
within 5 feet of you along electronic wires, and you can teleport to locations that you
can sense through this feature, teleporting you and any creatures along with you to the
nearest unoccupied space at the end of the connection.

##### Curse of the Machine Spirits

At 18th level, you can disable technology at a whim. Choose up to five items or devices
within 60 feet that you can see that are not artifacts. For 1 hour, these items lose any


enhanced benefits, and the item is turned off. These items can’t be restarted or turned
back on during this time, but a creature can attempt to restart the device by using their
action to make an Intelligence check against your psychic save DC, successfully
activating the device on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.

## Renegade

A ratling spy takes a moment, adjusting his night vision goggles. Tracing the outline of
the room with his eyes, he nimbly steps over the now-visible sensors lining the ground,
reaching the main console of the room. Within a moment, he reveals a selection of tools
and begins prying and pulling out cogitators and cogs until the machine gives a final
squeak and ceases to function. Shoving the tools back in his pockets, he watches over
his dataslate as his allies breach the facility’s doors, guns blazing.

A kroot stalks through the thick jungles, finding a thin-bladed leaf, a tinge of blood on its
one droplet. Silently, he climbs up the trunk of a tree, peering out over the distance to
see the camp of guardsmen he has been following for days. He trills to himself in delight
as he lowers his kroot rifle and steadies his shot.

The Tau caste dances before the haughty Imperial nobles, their faces flushed red with
bottles of wine littering the room. As the show ends and the music dies down, the lights
shut off, only for the Tau to unsheathe the dagger hidden inside of her boot, quickly
dashing across the room, mixing blood with wine.

Renegades, whether good, bad, or neutral, are those who focus on a specific practice
and utilize it to get the upper hand. They can come from any world or region in the
galaxy, with origins from the lowliest scoundrel to the social elite, from craven gangers
to respected spies.

#### Quick Build

You can make a renegade quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity
your highest ability modifier. Your next highest score should be Intelligence or Charisma.

##### Expertise

At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and
your proficiency with a security kit. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability
check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with the security
kit) to gain this benefit.

##### Sneak Attack

Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction.
Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack
if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged
weapon.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5
feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack
roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in
the Sneak Attack column of the Renegade table.

##### Cunning Action

Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly.
You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used
only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

##### Roguish Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your renegade


abilities, such as Thief. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then
again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

##### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can
increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

##### Uncanny Dodge

Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can
use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

##### Evasion

Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such
as a dreadnought’s _barrage_ or an _ice storm_ power. When you are subjected to an effect
that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead
take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

##### Reliable Talent

By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection.
Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can
treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

##### Blindsense

Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any
hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

##### Slippery Mind

By 15th level, your cunning grants you greater mental flexibility. You gain proficiency in
Wisdom saving throws. If you already have proficiency in Wisdom saving throws, you
can choose another saving throw to gain proficiency in.

##### Elusive

Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand
against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't Incapacitated.


##### Stroke of Luck

At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your
attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you
fail an ability check, you can treat The D20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Renegade Archetypes

Renegades have many features in common, but are highly specialized based on their
archetypes. These archetypes reflect their true training, such as being an assassin, spy,
or burglar.

#### Thief

You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other
criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do renegades who prefer to think of
themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In
addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into
ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using enhanced items you normally
couldn’t employ.

##### Fast Hands

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to
make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your security kit to disarm a trap or open a
lock, or take the Use an Object action.

##### Second-Story Work

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than
normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.

In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a
number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

##### Supreme Sneak

Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no
more than half your speed on the same turn.


##### Use Device

By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of technology and exotic
items that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you.
You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of enhanced and psychic
items.

##### Thief’s Reflexes

When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly
escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take
your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your Initiative minus 10.
You can’t use this feature when you are surprised.

#### Assassin

Assassins are dedicated to the craft of hunting their target down, and killing them as
quickly as possible.

##### Bonus Proficiencies

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit
and the poisoner’s kit.

##### Assassinate

Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies.
You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the
combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical
hit.

##### Infiltration Expertise

Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must
spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an
identity. You can't establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you
might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official-looking
certification to establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so
you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants.

Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be


that person until given an obvious reason not to.

##### Imposter

At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing,
and behavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these three components of
the person's behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing
mannerisms.

Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something
is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid
detection.

##### Death Strike

Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a
creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your
Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of
your attack against the creature.

## Soldier

As the sounds of artillery pounding the trenches looms ahead, the guardsmen press on,
bayonets at the ready, forever forced to engage the enemy. The Tau fire warriors
unload a barrage of blue energy from their weapons as they pound into the onslaught of
strange, red-skinned creatures that seemed to spawn out of nowhere. Space marines
march in total unison towards the overwhelming force of thousands of tyranids charging
in their direction.
From the stalwart space marines, to the humble guardsmen, to mercenaries,
assassins, and even tribal warriors vying for supremacy against nature, the soldier
makes up the common rank-and-file man that fights for a purpose.

#### Quick Build

You can make a soldier quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or
Dexterity your highest ability modifier, depending if you want to focus on melee or
ranged combat (or finesse weapons). Your next highest score should be Constitution.
Second, choose the military background.

**Hit Dice** : 1d10 per soldier level

##### Fighting Style

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose a Fighting Style from
the list of optional features. You can't take the same Fighting Style option more than
once, even if you get to choose again.

**_Blind Fighting._** You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you
can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in
darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the
creature successfully hides from you.
**_Defense._** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
**_Dueling._** When you are wielding a weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you
gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
**_Great Weapon Fighting._** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you
make with a weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and
must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-
handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
**_Interception._** When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5
feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target
takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be
wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
**_Superior Technique._** You learn one maneuver of your choice from among those
available to the Battle Master archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to
make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 +
your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice


you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority
die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you
finish a short or long rest.
**_Thrown Weapon Fighting._** You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as
part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged
attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
**_Two-Weapon Fighting._** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your
ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Furthermore, being within 5 feet of
a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with one-
handed weapons.
**_Unarmed Fighting._** Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6
+ your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren’t wielding any weapons or a shield when
you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8. At the start of each of your turns, you
can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.

##### Second Wind

You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm.
On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your
soldier level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you
can use it again.

##### Action Surge

Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On
your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a
possible bonus action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the
same turn.

##### Soldier Doctrine

At 3rd level, you choose the doctrine that shapes your abilities as a soldier. The
archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and
18th level.

##### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you
can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores
of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this


feature.

##### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the
attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to
four when you reach 20th level in this class.

##### Indomitable

Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must
use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times
between long rests starting at 17th level.

#### Soldier Doctrines

Different soldiers have different doctrines they train for to adapt to war. The soldier
doctrine you choose reflects your training and adaptations you have personally
undertaken for war.

#### Battle Master

The battle masters are those who employ a variety of maneuvers to devastate and
control the battlefield to their whims. These soldiers have a tool for every situation, and
seldom come unprepared.

##### Combat Superiority

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by
special dice called superiority dice.

**_Maneuvers._** You learn three maneuvers of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an
attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional
maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new
maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

**_Superiority Dice._** You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is
expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you
finish a short or long rest. You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at


15th level.

**_Saving Throws._** Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to
resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

```
Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier
(your choice)
```
##### Student of War

At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools or tech gadget of your
choice.

##### Know Your Enemy

Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another
creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities
compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or
inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:

```
⦁ Strength score
⦁ Dexterity score
⦁ Constitution score
⦁ Armor Class
⦁ Current hit points
⦁ Total class levels, if any
⦁ Soldier class levels, if any
```
##### Improved Combat Superiority

At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into d12s.

##### Relentless

Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining,
you regain 1 superiority die.

##### Battle Master Maneuvers

**_Ambush._** When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can
expend one superiority die and add the die to the roll.
**_Bait and Switch._** When you’re within 5 feet of an ally on your turn, you can expend
one superiority die and switch places with that ally, provided you spend at least 5 feet of


movement. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. Roll the superiority
die. Until the start of your next turn, the ally gains a bonus to AC equal to the number
rolled.
**_Brace._** When an enemy you can see moves within 5 feet of you, you can use your
reaction to expend one superiority die and make one weapon attack against that
creature. If the attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.
**_Distracting Strike._** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend
one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the
superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an
attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next
turn.
**_Evasive Footwork._** When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the
die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.
**_Goading Attack._** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one
superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority
die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you
until the end of your next turn.
**_Maneuvering Attack._** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more
advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and you
choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to
move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your
attack.
**_Menacing Attack._** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend
one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the
attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
**_Parry._** When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your
reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll
on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.
**_Precision Attack._** When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can
expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or
after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.
**_Pushing Attack._** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one
superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the
attack's damage roll, and if the target is large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving
throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.
**_Riposte._** When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction
and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If
you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.


**_Silver Tongue._** When you make a Deception check or a Persuasion check, you can
expend one superiority die, and add the superiority die to the ability check.
**_Studious Eye._** When you make an Insight check or an Investigation check, you can
expend one superiority die, and add the superiority die to the ability check.
**_Sweeping Attack._** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can
expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same
attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your
reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to
the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by
the original attack.
**_Technical Knock._** When you make a Piloting check or a Tech check, you can expend
one superiority dice, and add the superiority die to the ability check.
**_Trip Attack._** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one
superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the
attack's damage roll, and if the target is large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving
throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone

#### Champion

Champions are those who forward their cause with extreme efficiency. From the
daunting champions of Chaos to the humble guardsman, these champions offer fury and
might to whomever they fight alongside.

##### Improved Critical

Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a
critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

##### Remarkable Athlete

Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (rounded up) to any
Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn't already use your
proficiency bonus.

In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases
by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.

##### Additional Fighting Style

At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.


##### Superior Critical

Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.

##### Survivor

At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your
turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more
than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.

## Sorcerer

The tainted human reaches his hands upwards to the sky, summoning a colossal ball of
flame. Looking down at the feeble guardsmen sprawled out before him, their lasguns
shaking, he hurls the ball of flame before them, leaving naught but ash and dust in his
wake.

Sorcerers are psykers, but have the powers of the warp augmented by a daemon or
other being in the warp they have made a pact with. Some sorcerers might have made
pacts with less-maligned beings, such as with the rare living saint, but the vast majority
of them all have their powers from the daemons that watch over them.

#### Quick Build

You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Wisdom or
Charisma your highest ability score. Your next highest score should be Dexterity or
Constitution. Second, choose the heretic background.

##### Otherworldly Patron

At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice, such
as the Changer of Ways, or the Great Unclean One. Although patrons are most often
daemons, your patron might even be a powerful daemon primarch, a lesser daemon of
immense influence, a living saint, or even another sorcerer of unimaginable power. Your
choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

##### Psycasting

You have manifested the ability to channel the immaterium to fuel your psychic powers.
See chapter 10 for the general rules of casting powers and chapter 11 for the psychic
powers list.

**_Psychic Powers Known_**

You learn 9 psychic powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as
shown in the Psychic Powers Known column of the Sorcerer table. You may not learn a
psychic power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.

**_Psyker Points_**

You have a number of psyker points equal to your psyker level x 4, as shown in the
Psyker Points column of the Sorcerer table. When you cast a power, you expend a
number of psyker points equal to 1 + the power’s level. You regain all expended psyker
points when you finish a long rest.

**_Max Power Level_**

Many psychic powers can be overpowered, consuming more psyker points to create a
greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at
higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Psyker table.

You may only cast psychic powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the
ability to do so after a long rest.

**_Psycasting Ability_**

Your psycasting ability is the ability score you use to cast psychic powers. Your


psycasting ability can be either Wisdom or Charisma (your choice). You use this ability
score modifier whenever a power refers to your psycasting ability. Additionally, you use
this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psychic power you cast
and when making an attack roll with one.

```
Psychic save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your psycasting modifier
Psychic attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your psycasting modifier
```
##### Eldritch Invocations

In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of
forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding unnatural ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options
are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain sorcerer levels,
you gain additional invocations of your choice.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations
you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level. A
level prerequisite in an invocation refers to sorcerer level, not character level.

##### Pact Familiar

At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a loyal familiar for your service. You
learn the _summon familiar_ psychic power. The power doesn’t count against your
number of powers known.
When you cast this power, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar
or use the following special form, listed below, detailed in the Pact Familiar stat block.
You choose what this creature looks like. For example, a sorcerer of the Great Unclean
One might have his familiar take the form of a nurgling, while a sorcerer of the Changer
of Ways might have a blue horror as his familiar.

##### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase
one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your
choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##### Sorcerous Conjuration

Starting at 18th level, you can cast _summon daemon_ , without requiring concentration
and without expending psyker points. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you complete a long rest.

Additionally, if your total for a Wisdom (Occult) check is less than your psycasting ability
score, you can use that score in place of the total.

##### Master of Sorcery


At 20th level, when casting a psychic power of 5th-level or lower, you can choose to
deal maximum damage with the power, instead of rolling.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.

#### Otherworldly Patrons

Otherworldly patrons are the source of your power. You have some garnered power
from such a powerful being, and now that power festers inside of you. You gain features
based on your otherworldly patron that allow you to manifest your powers in unique
ways.

#### Changer of Ways

The Changer of Ways, most often associated with Tzeentch, is a being of powerful
psychic influence that offers its boons in pieces of forbidden knowledge and psychic
power.

##### Forbidden Tome

Starting at 1st level when you choose this patron, you have been granted a tome of
forbidden knowledge, and you determine its appearance when you summon it. You can
perform a ritual over ten minutes to summon this tome if you lose it, and anyone that
isn’t you that attempts to read this tome only reads incomprehensible gibberish. This
tome turns to ash when you die. While this tome is on your person, you can add your
Intelligence modifier to your Occult checks.

Additionally, you can use this tome to empower your psychic powers while it is on your
person. When you cast a psychic power, you can choose to empower it to be cast at one
level higher than you originally casted the power at, and this can exceed the maximum
power level you can cast a power at. You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses at the end of a long rest.

##### Awakened Mind

At 1st level, you have been granted the ability to speak telepathically to other creatures.
As a bonus action, you can establish a telepathic link to any creature you can see within
30 feet of you. While this link is established, you and the chosen creature can
telepathically speak to each other with this link. You and the chosen creature do not
need to understand the same language to speak to each other, but you must both speak
at least one language to speak to each other.


This telepathic link lasts for a 1 hour, and can reach out to a range of 1 mile. The link
ends early if you form a connection with another creature, or if you are no longer on the
same plane of existence as the other creature.

##### Warded Mind

At 6th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow
it. You also have resistance to psionic damage, and you have advantage on saving
throws against being charmed or frightened.

##### Rewrite Fate

Starting at 10th level, you have been granted the ability to rewrite fate. When an ability
check, saving throw, or attack roll is made within 60 feet of you, you can choose to
cause the creature to re-roll the result (no action required), and you can choose which
result they take.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

##### Crystal Maze

Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to
instantly transport the target through the endless crystal maze within Tzeentch’s realm.
The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare labyrinth for what feels like
years.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or
the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a daemon of Tzeentch, it takes 10d10
psionic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Great Unclean One

The Great Unclean One of Nurgle grants its patron the uncanny ability to survive even
near-lethal wounds, and powers of disease and filth.

##### Grandfather’s Embrace

Starting at 1st level when you choose this patron, you gain the embrace of the father of
pestilence. You have resistance to poison damage, you have advantage on saving throws
against being poisoned, and you are immune to all diseases. You cease to age, and
always appear as if you are in your prime.


Additionally, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever
you gain a level in this class.

##### Absorb Vitality

Also at 1st level, when a creature within 30 feet of you dies, you can use your reaction
to gain temporary hit points equal to your sorcerer level + your psycasting modifier (to a
minimum of 1).

##### Defy Death

Starting at 6th level, when you roll a 16 or higher on a death saving throw, it is treated
as if you rolled a 20 on the d20.

Additionally, when you succeed on a death saving throw, you can choose to regain a
number of hit points equal to your sorcerer level + your psycasting modifier. Once you
use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.

##### Toxic Skin

Starting at 10th level, your blood oozes with toxins. When you take damage from a
melee weapon attack, the attacker takes acid damage equal to your psycasting modifier.

##### Undying Bulwark

Starting at 14th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long
rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this
feature.

#### Eldritch Invocations

##### Armor of Shadows

You can cast _psychic armor_ on yourself at will, without expending psyker points.

##### Ascendant Step

_Prerequisite: 9th level_
You can cast _levitate_ on yourself at will, without expending psyker points.

##### Aspect of the Moon

You no longer need to sleep and can’t be forced to sleep by any means. To gain the


benefits of a long rest, you can spend all 8 hours doing light activity.

##### Beguiling Influence

You gain proficiency in two of the following skills: Deception, Intimidation, Performance
and Persuasion skills.

##### Cloak of Flies

_Prerequisite: 5th level_
As a bonus action, you can surround yourself with a psychic aura that looks like buzzing
flies. The aura extends 5 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. It
lasts until you’re incapacitated or you dismiss it as a bonus action.

The aura grants you advantage on Intimidation checks but disadvantage on all other
Charisma checks. Any other creature that starts its turn in the aura takes poison damage
equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 0 damage).

Once you use this invocation, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

##### Divulgence of Impurity

You gain resistance to radiant damage.

##### Eldritch Sight

You can read all writing.

You can cast _false life_ on yourself at will as a 1st-level power, without expending psyker
points.

##### Gaze of Two Minds

You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses
until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence
as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection,
extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the
other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature,
and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.


##### Ghostly Gaze

_Prerequisite: 7th level_
As an action, you gain the ability to see through solid objects to a range of 30 feet.
Within that range, you have darkvision if you don’t already have it. This special sight
lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a
power). During that time, you perceive objects as ghostly, transparent images.

Once you use this invocation, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

##### Gifts of the Depths

You can breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking
speed.

You can also cast _water breathing_ at will, without expending psyker points.

##### Gift of the Ever-Living Ones

Whenever you regain hit points while your familiar is within 100 feet of you, treat any
dice rolled to determine the hit points you regain as having rolled their maximum value
for you.

##### Mask of Many Faces

You can cast _mask of the deceiver_ at will, without expending psyker points.

##### Master of Myriad Forms

_Prerequisite: 15th level_
You can cast _alter self_ at will, without expending psyker points.

invisible until you move or take an action or a reaction.


##### Shroud of Shadow

_Prerequisite: 15th level_
You can cast _invisibility_ at will, without expending psyker points.

##### Tomb of Ahriman

_Prerequisite: 5th level_
As a reaction when you take damage, you can entomb yourself in sand, which disperses
at the end of your next turn. You gain 10 temporary hit points per sorcerer level, which
take as much of the triggering damage as possible. Immediately after you take the
damage, your speed is reduced to 0, and you are incapacitated. These effects, including
any remaining temporary hit points, all end when the sand disperses.

Once you use this invocation, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

##### Unholy Sight

You can see normally in darkness, even if it is created by enhanced means, to a distance
of 120 feet.

##### Visions of Distant Realms

_Prerequisite: 15th level_
You can cast _arcane eye_ at will, without expending psyker points.

##### Voice of the Chain Master

_Prerequisite: 3rd level_
You can communicate telepathically with your familiar and perceive through your
familiar’s senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence.

Additionally, while perceiving through your familiar’s senses, you can also speak through
your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech.

##### Waychanger’s Sight

transmutation effects and powers while the creature is within 30 feet of you and within
line of sight.

# Chapter 4: Personality & Background

## Languages

## Imperial Languages

Imperial languages are those present within the Imperium. These languages typically
represent drastically different dialects or ciphers, rather than entirely unique languages.

**_Heretic._** Cultists, mutants, and heretics that have found themselves affiliated with the
Ruinous Powers speak this guttural mixture of slang and Low Gothic to identify
themselves and enemies.
**_High Gothic._** Reserved for nobles and the well-educated, High Gothic is a scholarly
language, and many official and government documents are written in this language. It
is antiquated and proper, with very little slang or derogatory terms within it.
**_Imperial Codes._** Used by many of the armed forces, this language is a cipher used across
the many branches of the Imperium to quickly convey information while also concealing
its true message to any unobservant listener.
**_Low Gothic._** The standard language within the Imperium, almost every human that has
been touched by the Imperium knows this language.
**_Traders’ Cant._** An easy-to-learn cipher system used amongst traders, mercenaries, and
travelers to convey information using common phrases, lingo, and slang.
**_Tribal._** A simple and blunt language found on feudal and feral worlds.
**_Underworld._** From smugglers to chem dealers, Underworld is the language used for
thieves, outlaws, and criminals. It is full of slang, misnomers, and terms used to confuse
or disorient listeners unfamiliar with this language.

#### Exotic Languages

Exotic languages are obscure, alien, or only encountered within a small subset of
people. These languages are typically diverse and rarely found within the Imperium.

**_Aeldari._** The language of the eldar and all of its sub-factions, this is one of the most
complicated languages to know that is full of intricate wordings, phrases, and diverse
body language.
**_Binary._** Spoken by the followers of the Adeptus Mechanicum, this language is also the
same language that most Imperial machinery is programmed in. It consists of zeros and
ones, in both writing and speech.
**_Chaos._** Consisting of enigmatic runes, cryptic phrases, and otherworldly words, Chaos is
the embodiment of the daemons that speak it. Mortals that learn Chaos are usually
intune with the powers of Chaos, but some learn it to better understand and defeat
their foes.
**_Necrontyr._** The ancient language of the Necron, consisting of runes and low drones.
**_Orkish._** A language that consists more of violent gestures and grunts than actual words.
It is brutish, simple, and aggressive.
**_Tau._** The language of the Tau, consisting of light consonants and complex phrases. It is
often spoken with intricate idioms.

##### Feature: Contact Network

You are in frequent contact with people in the segment of society that your chosen
quarries move through. These people might be associated with the criminal underworld,
the rough-and-tumble folk of the streets, or members of high society. This connection
comes in the form of a contact in any civilized planet you visit that has at least one
member of your race on it, a person who provides information about the people and
places of the local area.

#### Chapter Serf

You are the serf of one of the many space marine chapters. Within each chapter is a
diverse and complex system of culture, tradition, and loyalties. As a chapter serf, you
are expected to maintain the equipment and armaments of space marines, provide
basic maintenance for the ships and faculties they use, and in dire circumstances,
defend the chapter’s fortress monastery and vessels while the space marines are not
present.

**Skill Proficiencies** : Choose two from among Lore, Medicine, Persuasion, and Tech.
**Languages** : One of your choice

4 Scribellum - The librarians of your chapter trained you to record the histories of the
chapter and create purity seals.
```
##### Feature: Serf Intuition

As a chapter serf, you are well-acquainted with space marines, and the culture and
traditions these battle-brothers share amongst each other. Although you most likely are
not allowed any secrets to your chapter, you are well aware of information such as their
primarch, training schedules, specialities, chapter organization, and general history.
Space marines of this chapter recognize you and your loyalty, and you are able to seek
refuge and shelter from people loyal to this chapter, assuming you do not accost or
endanger them.

circus, at a theater, or even in a noble's court. At such a place, you receive free lodging
and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the
establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes

familiar with the rituals, aspects, and traits of the deity or philosophy you have
worshipped. Furthermore, you are familiar with the results of said rituals, such as
mutations, boons, banes, and other identifying traits that members of that cult may

enough to know where the skilled healers and surgeons are, as well as where to find the
right medications or materials needed for healing. In a world of few physicians, you can
also easily trade your services. Setting up a clinic or healing tent in town for a few hours
can result in a free meal and roof over your head.

organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they

access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.

welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are.
The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure,

#### Pilgrim

You lived as a travelling pilgrim, going from holy sites across the galaxy in the name of
your faith. Along the pilgrim routes, you may have seen a fair amount of the galaxy,
from its wondrous cities of golden skyscrapers that touch the clouds, to planets that
amount to little more than barren deserts of rock and dust.

**Skill Proficiencies** : Choose two from among Lore, Occult, Performance, and Persuasion
**Languages** : Two of your choice
**Equipment** : A set of traveler’s clothes, and a pouch containing 50 g.

a set of traveler’s clothes, and 100 g

##### Feature: Vehicle Expert

In your time as a pilot, you’ve learned to identify any and all vehicles on the road. From
basic-model bicycles to high-tech star cruisers, you’re familiar with at least the basic
functions and features of most vehicles. If something is so exotic that you have not seen
it before, you can often pinpoint an origin or similarities the vehicle has to others you
may have seen.

#### Police Force

You were a part of a city’s police force, such as an arbitrator, or a planetary defense
force. You have served to protect the collective interests of the planet. Perhaps you
disagreed with some of the regulations on your home world, or perhaps you were an
ardent enforcer of the law, regardless of circumstance. Think about how your world
dealt with crime and the issues that plague the galaxy, and if your planet ever
experienced attacks or raids from outside forces.

**Tool Proficiencies** : Vehicles (land)

letter from a coworker about a case that went cold, and a pouch containing 100 g.

##### Feature: Police Rank

As a member of the police force, you have a badge of your office that displays your
authority. Using this, you can enter areas that might have been previously restricted and
access a modicum of their records based on your rank, such as local police records,
surveillance footage, and locals are more likely to trust you, unless you or your position
has a negative reputation.

**Equipment** : A book that was preserved with you, a small hourglass, a set of dated
common clothes, and a pouch containing 100 g.

##### Feature: Knowledge of the Ages

You are a relic of a different time—whether through cryogenic stasis, time travel, or
warp phenomena, you are from a time hundreds, if not thousands, of years in the past.
You can accurately recall any information from your time period, warranted that the
information was either common knowledge or involved you directly.

#### Raider

Within the galaxy, many species resort to raiding and pillaging. Whether it be the
common pirate, a brigand looking for his next meal, or an entire regiment gone rogue,
these raiders are found throughout the galaxy, in times of peace and war, and lead lives
of difficulty and strife in exchange for their self-perceived freedom.

**Skill Proficiencies** : Choose two from among Acrobatics, Athletics, Perception, Piloting
**Tool Proficiencies** : Security kit, navigator's tools, vehicles (land or space)
**Equipment** : A trophy taken from a raid such as a broken dagger or torn banner, a set of
common clothes, and a pouch containing 50 g.

##### Feature: Bad Reputation

No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to your reputation. When you are
in a civilized settlement, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing
to pay for food at a bar or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will
not report your activity to the authorities.

##### Feature: Ship’s Passage

When you need to, you can secure free passage on a ship for yourself and your
adventuring companions. You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you
have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because
you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your
every need. Your DM will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In
return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew
during the voyage.

#### Scavenger

Amongst the sprawling hive cities to the humblest of scrap yards, scavengers make their
living picking apart through the heaps and wreckages of littered technology to survive.
Some scavengers might come across a lively profession, joining a crew with a scavenging
ship dedicated to picking apart the wreckages of old battlefields in space or planet
hopping until they find valuable salvage.

**Skill Proficiencies** : Choose two from among Investigation, Lore, Sleight of Hand, and
Stealth.
**Tool Proficiencies** : Mechanic’s kit, one of your choice
**Equipment** : An unknown piece of heraldry, a broken weapon, and a unique piece of
minted currency, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a pouch containing 100 g.

##### Feature: Salvage

You know the best places to scavenge, and can make rudimentary gear out of the items
you scavenge. When you are in a civilized or urban area, you can spend several hours
scavenging around for scrap and junk in order to make an item that can be found under
Adventuring Gear found within Chapter 5: Standard Equipment, as long as the price is
100 g or less. This item is considered as near-useless to most merchants and vendors,
making it unable to be sold.

##### Feature: Researcher

When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information,
you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information
comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or
creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an
almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest
secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.


#### Slave

You were taken as a slave or an indentured servant. Whether you were asked to
perform menial tasks as a waiter, or forced to fight in a slave-army for a wealthy
governor, you share some things in common with other slaves of the same ilk.

**Skill Proficiencies** : Choose two from among Athletics, Acrobatics, Deception, and
Survival.
**Tool Proficiencies** : Two tools of your choice
**Equipment** : A set of traveler’s clothes, a pendant of a friend that is still enslaved, a
token from your previous owner such as an emblem, watch, or badge, and a pouch
containing 10 g.

##### Feature: Downtrodden Comradery

Within the greater galaxy, the need for labor is strong. From the common factory
worker to the humblest of slave-gladiators, you can find a friend in these folks. Using
these connections, you can find information about current politics from these slaves,
information about their masters, as well as what kind of work they do.

**Skill Proficiencies** : Choose two from among Athletics, Deception, Piloting, and
Investigation
**Tool Proficiencies** : Vehicles (one of your choice)
**Equipment** : A fancy leather vest or a pair of leather boots, a set of common clothes, and
a leather pouch with 150 g

##### Feature: Down Low

You are acquainted with a network of smugglers who are willing to help you out of tight
situations. While in a particular town, city, or other similarly sized community (DM's
discretion), you and your companions can stay for free in safe houses. Safe houses
provide a poor lifestyle. While staying at a safe house, you can choose to keep your
presence (and that of your companions) a secret.

#### Tech Priest

Within the Cult of the Machine God, the common members are known simply as tech
priests. These priests believe that true enlightenment comes from replacing the weak
flesh of the human body with the immortal structure of machines. Venerable members
of the Machine Cult may have only a few organs remaining that represent their original
human forms, while many become unrecognizable mixtures of machine and man shortly
after their initiation.

**Skill Proficiencies** : Choose two from among Lore, Medicine, Piloting, and Tech.
**Languages** : One of your choice
**Tool Proficiencies** : One tech gadget of your choice
**Equipment** : A symbol of the Mechanicum cog, a set of red robes of the Machine Cult
(fine clothes), a small piece of unknown technology such as a broken watch or stagnant


cogitator, and a pouch containing 100 g.

##### Feature: Machine Cult Implants

You have cybernetic implants from the Machine Cult, allowing you to attune to the
machine spirits of technology more easily. When interacting with a piece of technology,
such as a weapon, machine, or vehicle, you are able to communicate with its machine
spirit. You can learn how old the piece of technology is, the mood of the machine spirits,
as well as if it has been consecrated or desecrated. You may also learn other features
about the piece of technology at the GM’s discretion, depending on the intelligence of
the machine spirit. For example, a land raider may have more knowledge extending to
the battles it’s fought in, while a measly lasgun might only know how many times it’s
been fired in the past day.

specific deity or group.


# Chapter 5: Standard Equipment

If you are looking for enhanced items like bolt weapons, click HERE.

## Starting Equipment

When you create your character, you receive equipment based on a combination of
your class and background. Alternatively, you can start with an amount of gelt based on
your class and spend them on items from the lists in this section. See the Starting
Wealth by Class table to determine how much gold you have to spend.

You decide how your character came by this starting equipment. It might have been an
inheritance, or goods that the character purchased during his or her upbringing. You
might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and a backpack as part of military
service. You might even have stolen your gear. A weapon could be a family heirloom,
passed down from generation to generation until your character finally took up the
mantle and followed in an ancestor’s adventurous footsteps.

```
## Wealth

Wealth appears in many forms in the galaxy. Coins, gemstones, trade goods, art objects,
animals, and property can reflect your character’s financial well-being. Members of the
lower class trade in goods, bartering for what they need and paying tithes in grain and
cheese.

Members of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such as the rights to a mine, a port,
or farmland, or in gold bars or gemstones, measuring gold and gems by the pound
rather than by the coin. Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering professional
services for hire commonly deal in coins.

## Wealth Conversion Rates


Coinage has been converted into throne gelt, or gelt for short. The conversion rate is 1
sp = 1 Gelt. 10 gelt is equal to 1 gold, and so forth. If something is worth 100 gold,
multiply it by 10 to get its value in gelt. If the adventure is taking place in a non-Imperial
setting, the currency can change. For example, instead of gelt, you can use ork teeth.

#### Selling Treasure

Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the
worlds you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return
to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants
interested in your loot.

##### Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment

As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their
cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good
enough condition to sell.

##### Enhanced Items

Selling advanced technology is problematic. Finding someone to buy a vial of toxins or a
medpac isn't too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest
nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common enhanced items, you won't normally come
across enhanced items or powers to purchase. The value of rare technology is far
beyond simple gelt and should always be treated as such.

##### Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects

These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in
for currency or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable
treasures, the DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community
first.

##### Trade Goods and Other

On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and
art objects, trade goods--bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on--retain their full
value in the market and can be used as currency.

## Armor and Shields


##### Armor Class

Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines
your armor class (AC).

##### Armor Properties

**_Bulky._** While wearing armor with the bulky property, you have disadvantage on
Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on sound.
**_Strength._** While wearing armor or wielding a shield with the strength property, your
speed is reduced by 10 unless you meet the strength requirement.
**_Sealed._** While wearing this armor, you can breathe normally underwater and in toxic
environments, such as miasma and poisonous atmospheres, and you do not suffer
harmful effects from being in dangerous climates, such as deep underwater, high
altitude, heat, cold, radiation, or in a vacuum.

##### Light Armor

**_Mesh armor._** Often used by poorly equipped militiamen or thugs, the breastplate
and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of mesh that has been stiffened to
allow freedom of movement around joints whilst guarding the more vulnerable parts of
the body.
**_Fiber armor._** Made from tough fiber, interwoven into thin sheets, this armor
provides protection against blows while still allowing the wearer to not be encumbered
by armor.
**_Bodyglove._** This suit is made from cloisters of fibers that have been woven to form
an environmental seal at the cost of stealth, and are often found in the hands of
explorators and rogue traders.

##### Medium Armor

**_Chain mail._** Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted
fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows.
This is most commonly found on Feudal Worlds and within exceptionally poor fighting
forces.
**_Flak armor._** Commonly found amongst the soldiers of the Imperial Guard, this armor
is reinforced against ballistics and explosives, while still allowing a modicum of
movement to not restrict mobility.
**_Trooper armor._** Made of densely layered plates of armaplas, ceramite, or other
hardy materials, this armor has been modified to remove the armor around the
wearer’s joints to allow some freedom of movement. This armor is used by local
planetary defense forces and arbitrator patrols.


**_Composite armor._** Interlocking plates of carapace come together to form a layer of
protective coverings over the chest, shoulders, and thighs. This is issued to some officers
in the Imperial Guard and used by wealthy mercenaries.
**_Light power armor._** Thin plates of ceramite and armaplas are bolted onto a suit of
interwoven fibers and metal to provide a lightweight frame that allows a degree of
flexibility, as opposed to standard power armor. This is commonly used amongst elite
fighting forces, such as Sisters of Battle and high-ranking members of the Imperial
Guard.

##### Heavy Armor

**_Feudal plate._** Traditional plate armor typically found on Feudal Worlds made of
plates of steel or iron.
**_Battle armor._** Armor that restricts movement, but covers the wearer’s body and
joints in protective plates melded together to form a protective sheet over the majority
of the wearer’s body. This is often rewarded to a survivor of a few battles, and is often
found in the hands of veterans and officers.
**_Combat suit._** Thick plates made of ceramite or armaplas come together to create a
suit that encloses the wearer in its form. This is often used by shock troopers that have
survived many battles.
**_Power armor._** Ceramite plates are plastered onto a suit of interwoven fibers and
metals, and powered by an indefinite source of power, such as a plasma or nuclear
reactor, with a full seal that protects the user from the environment. Typically found in
the hands of Space Marines or Inquisitors, this armor is a mark of prestige and power.

##### Shields

**_Shield._** A shield is a round or rectangular barrier used to place something between
yourself and your attacker. Commonly found shields include riot shields, planks of wood,
or sheets of metal.

## Weapon Properties

**_Ammunition._** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a
ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you
attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. If you use a weapon that
has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an
improvised weapon.
**_Finesse._** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your
Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same
modifier for both rolls.
**_Light._** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when
fighting with two weapons. See the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9.
**_Range._** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in
parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers.
The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s
maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage
on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.
**_Reach._** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach with it.
**_Loading._** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one
piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it,
regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
**_Reload._** A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload
property. A character must then reload it (no action required). You must have one free
hand to reload.
**_Special._** A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use,
explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).


**_Strength._** A weapon with this special property has a heavy kickback. While wielding
it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls using that weapon unless you meet the
Strength requirement.
**_Thrown._** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a
ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for
that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon.
**_Two-Handed._** This weapon requires two hands to use.
**_Versatile._** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in
parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon is used with two
hands to make a melee attack.

#### Special Weapons

**_Net_**_._ A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has
no effect on formless or Huge or larger creatures. A creature can use its action to make
a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success.
The net has an AC of 10, 5 hit points, and immunity to all damage not dealt by melee
weapons. Destroying the net frees the creature without harming it and immediately
ends the net’s effects. While a creature is restrained by a net, you can make no further
attacks with it.
**_Flamer_**_._ Instead of choosing a target to attack, the flamer shoots out a gout of flame in a
10-foot line that is 5 feet wide. You make attack rolls against the creatures within the
line of flame, and on a successful hit, the target takes damage from the flamer. Flamers
use promethium as ammunition.

#### Improvised Weapons

Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at
hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands,
such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead snotling.

Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such.
For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM's option, a character proficient with
a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her
proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a
damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a
melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also
deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a
long range of 60 feet.


#### Blessed Weapons

Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonenhanced weapons are
susceptible to blessed weapons, so cautious witchhunters invest extra gelt to bless their
weapons. You can bless a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 1,000 gelt. This
cost represents not only the price of the holy ointments and unguents, but the time and
expertise needed to bless the weapon with the proper rites and ceremonies.

Ammunition comes in many forms, but is most often found in the form of magazines or
cartridges. A magazine or cartridge is a way to store ammunition, such as bullets or bolts
shells. One magazine or cartridge carries all of the ammunition a ranged weapon
requires before needing to be reloaded. At the GM’s discretion, exotic ammunition
(such as plasma cartridges) may be too difficult to find in certain locations, may require
additional efforts to be found, or be purchased at a higher cost.

##### Ammo Bag

An ammo bag is a leather pouch that can be fitted to a backpack or waist that has
compartments to hold all of the ammunition used for weapons. While an ammo bag is
on your person, you are always considered as having ammunition available to reload a
weapon, unless a weapon specifies it needs a special type of ammunition (such as
mortar shells or grenades).

##### Dart

These are darts used as throwing projectiles. They are less than a foot long in length,
and typically made of wood or metal and sharpened to a point.

##### Magazine


This is used to supply ammunition for weapons that deal kinetic damage. One magazine
has all of the ammunition needed until a weapon needs to be reloaded.

##### Power Cell

A power cell is used to power small electrical objects or as ammunition for weapons.
One power cell provides enough ammunition for a weapon that deals energy damage
until it needs to be reloaded. Power cells can also be used to fuel enhanced weapons
that do not deal kinetic damage, such as plasma weapons.

##### Promethium

Promethium is a combustible, gasoline-like liquid that is used to fuel most vehicles and
some forms of weaponry, such as flamers. It is most often found within the Imperium of

Man, but some other factions use it due to its simplicity and versatility.

#### Commlink

Commlinks are standard handheld communication devices, fitted with microphones and
receivers. A standard, personal commlinks have a range of up to 30 miles, but are
reduced in dense, urban areas or areas of high level interference.

##### Comm Jammer

A comm jammer is a device used to scramble communications. A comm jammer can
block transmissions from nonenhanced communications devices in a 100 foot radius.

##### Long-range Comm

Long-range comms usually come in the form of voxcasters: bulky radios that require a
steady supply of power. When used, a long-range comm is able to transmit and receive


messages up to thousands of miles away, such as from planetside to an orbiting
satellite. Due to the nature of such a device, encryption is very difficult, if not
impossible.

##### Comm Tracker

As an action, you can use this to detect other active commlinks within 30 feet. When
used in this way, it briefly disrupts comm frequencies.

##### Pocket Scrambler

A pocket scrambler is a simple add-on to any commlink that automatically encodes any
messages sent out. The transmitted message can only be read by a device equipped
with a matched scrambler that can decode the message.

##### Headcomm

A headcomm can be installed in a helmet or worn independently. It functions as a
hands-free commlink.

#### Data Recording & Storage

##### Data Slate

Data slates are common across the universe, and are the primary means of storing and
reading printed text and other forms of data such as picts of audio recordings.

##### Pict Recorder

The pict recorder is a rectangular object with a lens on the front used to capture
pictures, motion pictures, and audio. A pict recorder can be placed inside of a servo skull
for constant recording duties. The information stored on a Pict Recorder can be
uploaded to data slates and other recording devices.

##### Voice Recorder

A voice recorder is a small device that can be hidden under clothes or armor and can
capture audio. This device must be connected to a data slate or similar storage device in

Mine, Thermal 550 g 2 lbs.
Thermal Detonator 750 g 1 lbs.
```
##### Breaching Charge

A device used to blow holes in larger constructs, a breaching charge creates a
devastating explosion. Installing a breaching charge takes 1 minute. The charge can be
set with a 6-second timer, or detonated remotely using a remote detonator.

Once detonated, the breaching charge destroys an nonenhanced section of wall up to
10 feet wide, 10 feet tall, and 5 feet deep. Additionally, each creature within 20 feet of
the charge must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage
and 3d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. A
construct makes this save with disadvantage. If the breaching charge is installed on the
construct, it automatically fails the saving throw.

##### Explosive Collar

Explosive collars are devices that are fitted onto the necks of creatures to ensure
humanoids. The collar requires one minute to install onto a creature of Large or smaller
size, and is connected to a remote that can be activated from up to 120 feet away.
When activated, the collar explodes in a 5 foot radius, and any creatures inside of the
radius must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage plus 3d6
kinetic damage on a failure, and half as much on a success. Once detonated, the collar is
destroyed and turned into an unusable husk. As an action, the collar can be removed by
a DC 11 Intelligence (Tech) skill check, or by a DC 11 Dexterity skill check using a security
kit. If the skill check fails, the explosive detonates. On a success, the collar is removed
without incident, and the explosives can be disarmed as part of removing the collar.


##### Grenade, Stun

Stun grenades are usually used when the object of a mission is to detain, capture, or
subdue rather than kill. Grenades can be thrown up to 60 feet. As an action, you can
throw a grenade at a point you can see within range. Each creature within 10 feet must
make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed
save, or half as much as on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature
is stunned until the end of its next turn.

##### Grenade, Fragmentation

Frag grenades are cheap, low-damage grenades used mainly by military personnel,
mercenaries, bounty hunters, and adventurers. Grenades can be set to detonate on
impact or set with a timer that lasts several seconds before detonating. Grenades can be
thrown up to 60 feet. As an action, you can throw a grenade at a point you can see
within range. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. A
creature takes 2d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful
one.

##### Grenade, Gas

Gas grenades are primarily used to flush enemies out of cover and other protected
areas, though there are of course other uses. Grenades can be thrown up to 60 feet. As
an action, you can throw a grenade at a point you can see within range. The grenade
explodes in a 15-foot-radius sphere of yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose
within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It
lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses it.

When a creature enters the fog’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there,
that creature must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 1d6
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is poisoned while it is in the cloud. Constructs
and humanoids wearing appropriate protective equipment are unaffected.

##### Grenade, Haywire

Haywire grenades are hand-held explosive devices that release a blast of electric
energy. Grenades can be thrown up to 60 feet. As an action, you can throw a grenade at
a point you can see within range. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 12
Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d4 lightning damage on a failed save, or half
as much as on a successful one. Any nonenhanced electronics that are not being worn
or wielded within the blast radius are disabled until rebooted.


##### Mine, Fragmentation

When you use your action to set it, this mine sets an imperceptible laser line extending
up to 15 feet. When the laser is tripped, the mine explodes, and each creature within 15
feet of it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes
3d6 kinetic damage, or half as much on a successful one.

##### Mine, Thermal

When you use your action to set it, this mine sets an imperceptible laser line extending
up to 15 feet. When the laser is tripped, the mine explodes, coating the area in a 15-foot
radius around it in fire that burns for 1 minute. When a creature enters the fire or starts
its turn there it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature takes 2d6 fire damage, or half as much on a successful one. A construct makes
this save with disadvantage.

##### Thermal Detonator

Thermal detonators are palm-sized, spherical, and extremely deadly explosive weapons.
In addition to being surprisingly powerful for their size, they can only be turned off by
whoever turned them on. Thermal detonators have a range equal to 30 feet + your
Strength modifier x 5. As an action, you can throw a thermal detonator at a point you
can see within range. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving
throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire and 2d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as
much as on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is knocked
prone.

such as miasma and poisonous gas, and you do not suffer harmful effects from being in
dangerous climates, such as deep underwater, high altitude, heat, cold, radiation, or
vacuums.

##### Flight Suit

Flight suits, or jumpsuits, are a type of outfit worn by pilots. They are worn in
conjunction with flight helmets. They come in a variety of different colors and provide
life support.

While wearing a full flight suit, you can last twice as long before suffering negative
effects when exposed to the effects of a vacuum, environmental radiation, and
environmental effects such as the extremes of heat and cold, and high and low
altitudes. Furthermore, you have advantage on saving throws against these harmful
environmental effects.

##### Respirator

A respirator, or breath mask, is a portable device that allows an oxygen-breather to
survive in low-oxygen atmospheres. Although not suitable for use in outer-space, these
hands-free masks were essential equipment for exploring unknown planets. While
wearing a respirator, you have advantage on saving throws against poisons that rely on
being inhaled, and against environmental effects that rely on being inhaled, such as
noxious miasma.

##### Antitoxin Kit

An antitoxin kit is standard-issue Imperial equipment to those designated for
environments with hostile native xeno life that rely on poisons and venom to survive. A
kit has five charges. As an action, you can administer a charge of the kit to cure a target
of one poison affecting them or to give them advantage on saving throws against poison
for 1 hour. This provides no benefits to constructs.

##### Basic Poison

You can use the poison in this vial to coat one kinetic weapon or up to three pieces of
ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned
weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4
poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.

##### Emergency Battery

All non-expendable machinations need recharging as they are used. The battery has ten
uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a construct or object
that has 0 hit points, without needing to make an Intelligence (Tech) check.

##### Trauma Kit

A common trauma kit can be stocked with chirurgeon equipment such as scalpels,
knives, and bonesaws, and contains spray-bandages, bone stabilizers, antiseptics, and
other essentials for the treatment of wounds. As an action, you can expend a use of the
kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom
(Medicine) check. A trauma kit can be used to stabilize 5 times before it must be
restocked at its original cost.

##### Repair Kit

A repair kit included the basic tools needed to repair a droid after being damaged in
combat. The kit has three uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to
restore 2d4+2 hit points to a droid or construct within 5 feet.

##### Chrono

A chrono is a device that measures and keeps linear time. It can be worn on the wrist, or
on a chain attached to a piece of clothing.

##### Distress Beacon

A distress beacon is a bulky electronic box used to send your location quickly through
space to attempt to alert others that you are in distress and the coordinates of where
the distress beacon is located at. Although it can be helpful to be located, the distress
signal itself does not provide any information about its user, the people requesting help,
or the type of problem being encountered.

##### Field Rations (1 day)

Ration packs consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, and are used when other
food is scarce. Each pack is divided into portions and can provide enough food for one
person per day.

##### Fusion Cutter

A fusion cutter is a handheld cutting tool popular among technicians. It cut through
almost any reinforced material, given enough time. The internal power cell supplies an
hour’s worth of continuous operation.

##### Glow Lamp

Glow lamps create a beam of light illuminating the area around you in bright light for a
20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The glow lamp lasts for 1 hour and
can be recharged by connecting to a power source or by replacing the power cell.

##### Grappling Hook

A grappling hook allows a user to climb or ascend large objects at your walking speed or
your climbing speed, whichever is faster. It can be mounted to a gun, belt, or elsewhere.
It has a 50-foot length.


##### Heat Generator

Heat generators are special devices typically worn on belts that function as a portable,
personal heat supply. Activating or deactivating the generator requires a bonus action
and, while active, you are adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the
Dungeon Master’s Guide. The generator lasts for 1 hour and can be recharged by a
power source or replacing the power cell.

##### Homing Beacon

A homing beacon is a device used to track starships or any other entity being
transported. Homing beacons can’t be tracked through warp travel. Homing beacons
are small enough that they can easily be hidden inside a ship, or tucked into some
crevice on its exterior.

A homing beacon can be connected to a data-slate or similar recording device to receive
information of the beacon’s coordinates at any given time.

##### Macrobinoculars

Macrobinoculars are handheld viewing devices that allow users to observe distant
objects. Some models are able to see into space from the surface of a planet.

##### Maglock Boots

These boots can be used to magnetically lock onto a flat, metallic surface, such as a
ship’s hull. While maglocked, you can move up, down, and across metallic vertical
surfaces and upside down along metallic ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

While maglocked, you do not suffer the effects of being pushed away by effects of the
environment, such as the vacuum of space or powerful winds.

##### Manacles

These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles
requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20
Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature
proficient with security kits can pick the manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity
check. Manacles have 15 hit points.

##### Mess Kit

This box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can


be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.

##### Ram, Portable

You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +5 bonus
on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you
advantage on this check.

##### Restraining Bolt

Restraining bolts are small, cylindrical devices that can be affixed to a construct in order
to limit its functions and enforce its obedience. When inserted, a restraining bolt
restricts the construct from any movement its master does not desire, and also forced it
to respond to signals produced by a hand-held control unit.

Installing a restraining bolt takes 1 minute. The construct must make a DC 13
Constitution saving throw. A hostile construct makes this save with advantage. On a
successful save, the restraining bolt overloads and is rendered useless. On a failed save,
the restraining bolt is correctly installed, and the control unit can be used to actively
control the construct. While the control unit is inactive, the construct can act freely but
it can not attempt to remove the restraining bolt.

While wearing these items, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and
ceilings while leaving your hands free. You also gain a climbing speed equal to your
walking speed.

##### Jetpack

Jetpacks are personal aerial transportation devices that allow the operator to fly into
and through the air with great mobility. Activating or deactivating the jetpack requires a
bonus action and, while active, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. The jetpack lasts for 1
minute per quart of promethium (to a maximum of 10 minutes) and can be refueled as
an action.

##### Remote Detonator

A small handheld device with a single button, used to activate explosives. Over the
course of 1 minute, you can synchronize the detonator with a single explosive device,
such as a breaching charge, grenade, or mine. As an action, you can remotely detonate
the paired explosive up to a range of 300 feet.

##### Rocket Boots

##### Tracker Utility Vest

A utility vest is a sleeveless item of clothing that includes several evenly-distributed
pockets, popular among hunters, smugglers, and adventurers. The vest is made of
leathery, hide material to resist rips, corrosion and water. The wearer can carry up to 10
light items (up to 1 lb each) without increasing their total encumbrance.

## Tools

A tool helps you to do something you couldn’t otherwise do, such as craft or repair an
item, pick a lock, or slice into a computer. Your species, class, background, or feats give
you proficiency with certain tools, which lets you add your proficiency bonus to any
ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since
proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use.

grafts. Proficiency in these tools allows you to add your proficiency bonus to your checks
to perform such operations.

##### Torturer’s Kit

#### Trade Goods

Trade is an essential part of the galactic economy. Many traders make their living buying
and selling goods along interstellar routes that connect a sector’s major worlds.

A merchant may be chartered by an individual or a corporation to deliver goods to a
certain port, or move goods along a specified route. During times of war, opportunities
are abound in the shipping of ammunition and medical supplies. Some traders, seeking
to earn a quick profit, may resort to smuggling illegal or restricted cargo on behalf of
one of the galaxy’s many crime syndicates. The Trade Goods table shows the value of
commonly exchanged goods.

# Chapter 6: Customization Options

The combination of ability scores, race, class, and background defines your character’s
capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart
from every other character. Even within your class and race, you have options to fine-
tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for players who—with the GM’s
permission—want to go a step further.

This chapter defines two optional sets of rules for customizing your character:
multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine classes together, and feats are
special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain
levels. Your GM decides whether these options are available in a campaign.

## Multiclassing

Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the
abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in
one of the standard class options.

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you
advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your
classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have
three levels in psyker and two in soldier, you’re a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class
with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never
looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or
fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice some
focus in exchange for versatility.

##### Multiclassing Example

Bob is playing a 4th-level soldier. When his character earns enough experience points to
reach 5th level, Bob decides that his character will multiclass instead of continuing to
progress as a fighter. Bob’s soldier has been spending a lot of time with Jim’s renegade,
and has even been doing some jobs on the side as a bounty hunter. Bob decides that his
character will multiclass into the renegade class, and thus his character becomes a 4th-
level soldier and 1st-level renegade (written as fighter 4/renegade 1).


When Bob’s character earns enough experience to reach 6th level, he can decide
whether to add another soldier level (becoming a soldier 5/renegade 1), another
renegade level (becoming a soldier 4/renegade 2), or a level in a third class, perhaps
dabbling in the technology thanks to a archaeotech dataslate he acquired (becoming a
soldier 4/renegade 1/mechnician 1).

#### Prerequisites

To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your
current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For
example, a soldier who decides to multiclass into the psyker class must have either
Strength or Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores of 13 or higher. Without the full
training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new
class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

**Multiclassing Prerequisites
Class Ability Score Minimum**
Augmenticist Strength or Dexterity 13
Berserker Strength 13
Courser Strength or Dexterity 13, Intelligence 13
Crusader Strength 13 or Dexterity 13
Exorcist Constitution 13, Wisdom or Charisma 13
Mechnician Intelligence 13
Psyker Wisdom or Charisma 13
Renegade Dexterity 13
Soldier Strength or Dexterity 13
Sorcerer Wisdom or Charisma 13

#### Experience Points

The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as
shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular
class. So, if you are a psyker 6/soldier 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level
before you can take your second level as a soldier or your seventh level as a psyker.

#### Hit Points and Hit Dice

You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the
1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.


You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If
the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example,
both the soldier and the exorcist have a d10, so if you are a soldier 5/exorcist 5, you
have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of
them separately. If you are a soldier 5/renegade 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit
Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.

#### Proficiency Bonus

Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the
Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class. For
example, if you are a soldier 3/renegade 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level
character, which is +3.

If a feature or feat allows you to forgo your proficiency bonus, you may only do so once.

#### Proficiencies

When you gain a level in a class other than your first, you gain only some of that class’s
starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

**Multiclassing Proficiencies
Class Proficiencies Gained**
Augmenticist Light armor, claws, shortswords
Berserker Light armor, simple weapons, martial weapons
Courser Light armor, medium armor, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill
from the class’s list
Crusader Light armor, medium armor, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill
from the class’s list
Exorcist Light armor, medium armor, simple weapons, martial weapons
Mechnician Light armor, security kit, one skill from the class’s list, two tech gadgets
Psyker —
Renegade Light armor, simple weapons, two skills from the class’s list
Soldier Light armor, medium armor, simple weapons, martial weapons
Sorcerer —

#### Class Features


When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. A few features,
however, have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Extra Attack, Superiority Die,
Unarmored Defense, and Force- or Tech-casting.

#### Extra Attack

If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t
add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you
do.

#### Unarmored Defense

If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it again from
another class.

#### Psycasting and Techcasting

Your capacity for psycasting and techcasting depends partly on your combined levels in
all your psycasting or techcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those
classes. Once you have the psycasting or techcasting feature from more than one class,
use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the psycasting or techcasting feature
from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

##### Powers Known

You determine what powers you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if
you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a courser 4/psyker 3, for
example, you know 6 tech powers of no higher than 1st-level. As a 3rd-level psyker, you
know 11 force powers of no higher than 2nd-level.

Each power you know is associated with one of your classes, and you use the psycasting
or techcasting ability of that class when you cast the power.

##### Psyker and Tech Points

You determine your available force or tech points by adding together the amount given
by each class.

If you have both psyker and tech points, you keep your pools separate, and they can


only be used to fuel psychic or tech powers, respectively.

##### Max Power Level

When multiclassing, you determine your Max Power Level by first determining your
casting level total. To determine this total, you add up your total psycasting or
techcasting levels, and rounding down for the final result. Exorcists and coursers only
count as half of a psycasting or techcasting level. Finally, you consult the Multiclass Max
Power Level table below.

For example, if you have three levels in exorcist, which has 1.5 psycasting levels, and
three levels in psyker, which has 3 psycasting levels, your total psycasting level is 4.5,
rounded down to 4. You then compare that to the Multiclass Max Power Level table,
and see that as a 4th-level caster, your max power level is 2nd level.

If you have both psycasting and techcasting, you determine your Max Power Levels
separately, and they can only be used to cast psychic or tech powers, respectively.

**Multiclass Max Power Level
Caster Level Max Power Level**
1st-2nd 1st
3rd-4th 2nd
5th-6th 3rd
7th-8th 4th
9th-10th 5th
11th-12th 6th
13th-14th 7th
15th-16th 8th
17th-18th-19th-20th 9th

##### High-Level Casting

When determining the number of higher level powers you can cast before needing a
long rest, consult the rules for casting in the class in which you have the most levels.

# Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores

Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature’s physical and mental
characteristics.

```
⦁ Strength , measuring physical power
⦁ Dexterity , measuring agility
⦁ Constitution , measuring endurance
⦁ Intelligence , measuring reasoning and memory
⦁ Wisdom , measuring perception and insight
⦁ Charisma , measuring force of personality
```
## Ability Scores and Modifiers

Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that
ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses
a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but soldiers and many monsters are a
cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually
reaches. Player characters can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine
beings can have scores as high as 30.

Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an
ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes
the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage
on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a
second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have
advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have
disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll
those numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes
disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable
situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are
considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple
circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In
such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the
halfling's Lucky trait, lets you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace only one
of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or
disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky
trait to reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions,
or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The DM can also decide that
circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or
impose disadvantage as a result.

## Proficiency Bonus

Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, as detailed in "Step-By-Step


Characters." Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks.
The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than
once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a
Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the
save.

Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved,
for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the
proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your
proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and
multiply or divide it only once.

By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus
when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency
bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus
is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack
proficiency in the Lore skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your
proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (Lore) checks.

In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If
a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.

## Ability Checks

An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to
overcome a challenge. The DM calls for an ability check when a character or monster
attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the
outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at
hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a
task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.

```
Task Difficulty Difficulty Class (DC)
Very easy 5
Easy 10
Medium 15
Hard 20
Very hard 25
```

```
Nearly Impossible 30
```
To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other
d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total
equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success--the creature overcomes the
challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster
makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback
determined by the DM.

#### Contests

Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This
can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed,
such as attempting to snatch up a ring that has fallen on the floor.

This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from
accomplishing a goal--for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an
adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a
special form of ability check, called a contest.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They
apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC,
they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total
wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents
the other one from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the
contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a
contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a
monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie
means that the door remains shut.

#### Skills

Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a
monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and
an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character's
starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's skill
proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.)

For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an


acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity
has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a
character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks
related to sneaking and hiding.

The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are
related to Constitution.) See an ability's description in the later sections of this section
for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.

```
Strength Dexterity Intelligence Wisdom Charisma
Athletics Acrobatics Investigation Occult Deception
Sleight of Hand Lore Insight Intimidation
Stealth Nature Medicine Performance
Piloting Perception Persuasion
Tech Survival
```
#### Variant: Skills with Different Abilities

Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check.
Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some
situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check.
In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and
skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For
example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your DM might
call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this
case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a
Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you're proficient in Athletics, you apply your
proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength
(Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength
to intimidate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even
though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.

#### Passive Checks

A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a
check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for
secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the DM wants to secretly
determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as
noticing a hidden monster.

Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:


```
10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check
```
If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The
game refers to a passive check total as a **score**.

For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception,
he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.

The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the
exploration rules.

#### Working Together

Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's
leading the effort--or the one with the highest ability modifier--can make an ability
check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat,
this requires the Help action.

A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone.
For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character
who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task.

Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together
would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with
help.

#### Group Checks

When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the DM
might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at
a particular task help cover those who aren't.

To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least
half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.

Otherwise, the group fails. Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most
useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when
adventurers are navigating a swamp, the DM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival)
check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural
hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful


characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group
stumbles into one of these hazards.

## Using Each Ability

#### Strength

Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can
exert raw physical force.

##### Strength Checks

A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force
your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The
Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.

##### Athletics

Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing,
jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:

```
⦁ You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall,
or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.
⦁ You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.
⦁ You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves,
or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you
underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.
```
##### Other Strength Checks

The DM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the
following:

```
⦁ Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
⦁ Break free of bonds
⦁ Push through a tunnel that is too small
⦁ Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it
⦁ Tip over a statue
⦁ Keep a boulder from rolling
```

##### Strength Attack Rolls and Damage

You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking
with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons
to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to
make a ranged attack.

##### Lifting and Carrying

Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms
define what you can lift or carry.

**Carrying Capacity.** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is
the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters
don't usually have to worry about it.

**Push, Drag, or Lift.** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your
carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in
excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.

**Size and Strength.** Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can
carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity
and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.

##### Variant: Encumbrance

The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are
looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the
weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the
Armor table.

If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are **encumbered** , which
means your speed drops by 10 feet.

If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum
carrying capacity, you are instead **heavily encumbered** , which means your speed drops
by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws
that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

#### Dexterity

Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.


##### Dexterity Checks

A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep
from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect
aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.

##### Acrobatics

Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky
situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope,
or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity
(Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls,
somersaults, and flips.

##### Sleight of Hand

Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting
something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity
(Sleight of Hand) check. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to
determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of
another person's pocket.
Stealth

Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies,
slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without
being seen or heard.

##### Other Dexterity Checks

The DM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the
following:

```
⦁ Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
⦁ Steer a chariot around a tight turn
⦁ Pick a lock
⦁ Disable a trap
⦁ Securely tie up a prisoner
⦁ Wriggle free of bonds
⦁ Play a stringed instrument
⦁ Craft a small or detailed object
```

##### Dexterity Attack Rolls and Damage

You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking
with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity
modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon
that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.

##### Armor Class

Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier
to your Armor Class.

##### Initiative

At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check.
Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in combat.

**HIDING**
The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to
hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that
check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that
actively searches for signs of your presence.

You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your
position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase. An
invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it
does have to stay quiet.

In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you
come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain
circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that
is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.

Passive Perception. When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you
even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the
DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom
(Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any
other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage,
subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a
Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive
Wisdom (Perception) of 14.


What Can You See? One of the main factors in determining whether you can find
a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be lightly or
heavily obscured, as explained in chapter 8.

#### Constitution

Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.

##### Constitution Checks

Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because
the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific
effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your
attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.

The DM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the
following:

```
⦁ Hold your breath
⦁ March or labor for hours without rest
⦁ Go without sleep
⦁ Survive without food or water
⦁ Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go
```
#### Hit Points

Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your
Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.

If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as
though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your
Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases
from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always
been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points
for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you're 7th level and some effect lowers your
Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point
maximum is reduced by 7.

#### Intelligence

Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.


##### Intelligence Checks

An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education,
memory, or deductive reasoning. The Investigation, Lore, Nature, Piloting, and Tech
skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.

##### Nature

Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants
and animals, the weather, natural cycles, xeno lifeforms, types of planets, and the
biology regarding other organisms.

##### Lore

Your Intelligence (Lore) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical
events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost
civilizations.

##### Investigation

When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make
an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object,
discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the
weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls
in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence
(Investigation) check.

##### Piloting

Your Intelligence (Piloting) check measures your ability to remember and follow traffic
laws as they differ from planet-to-planet and manipulate and maneuver vehicles.

##### Tech

Your Intelligence (Tech) check measures your ability to recall information about
technology and the rituals used to maintain and use them, identifying pieces of
technology from archaeotech to xenocraft, and how to discern the functions of
unknown tech.

##### Other Intelligence Checks

The DM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the
following:


```
⦁ Communicate with a creature without using words
⦁ Estimate the value of a precious item
⦁ Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard
⦁ Forge a document
⦁ Recall lore about a craft or trade
⦁ Win a game of skill
```
##### Spellcasting Ability

Techies and Coursers use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine
the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.

#### Wisdom

Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents
perceptiveness and intuition.

##### Wisdom Checks

A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s
feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Insight,
Medicine, Occult Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of
Wisdom checks.

##### Insight

Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of
a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing
so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in
mannerisms.

##### Medicine

A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an
illness.

##### Occult

Your Wisdom (Occult) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and
prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults, as well as
creatures from the warp or beyond reality and their abilities.


##### Perception

Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence
of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the
keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a
closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in
the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether
they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or
candlelight under a closed secret door.

**FINDING A HIDDEN OBJECT**
When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a
trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can
be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise
overlook.

In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to
determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded
clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room,
looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key,
regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you
were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of
success.

##### Survival

The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild
game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live
nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards. When there
is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from
getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the DM might call for a Wisdom
(Survival) check. You also make a Wisdom (Survival) check to control your mount when
you attempt a risky maneuver.

##### Other Wisdom Checks

The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the
following:

```
⦁ Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
⦁ Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead
```

##### Spellcasting Ability

Psykers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving
throw DCs of spells they cast.

#### Charisma

Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such
factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding
personality.

##### Charisma Checks

A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you
try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky
social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect
aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.

##### Deception

Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the
truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything
from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations
include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass
yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a
straight face while telling a blatant lie.

##### Intimidation

When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and
physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check.
Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to
back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a
sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

##### Performance

Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience
with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

##### Persuasion

When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces,


or good nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically,
you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial
requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing
a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes,
or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

##### Other Charisma Checks

The DM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the
following:

```
⦁ Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
⦁ Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation
```
##### Spellcasting Ability

Paragons and wards use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine
the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.

#### Saving Throws

A saving throw--also called a save--represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a
poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw;
you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For
example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.

A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by
advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the DM.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is
proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw
lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a
particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For
example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s
spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows
the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced


harm, from an effect.


# Chapter 8: Adventuring

Delving into the ancient Necron tomb, slipping through the back alleys of a hive world,
hacking a fresh trail through the thick jungles on a remote feral world—these are the
things that Warhammer 40k adventures are made of. Your character in the game might
explore forgotten ruins and uncharted lands, uncover dark secrets and sinister plots,
and slay foul monsters. And if all goes well, your character will survive to claim rich
rewards before embarking on a new adventure.

This section covers the basics of the adventuring life, from the mechanics of movement
to the complexities of social interaction. The rules for resting are also in this section,
along with a discussion of the activities your character might pursue between
adventures.

Whether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon or the complex relationships of a
royal court, the game follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book’s introduction:

```
⦁ The DM describes the environment.
⦁ The players describe what they want to do.
⦁ The DM narrates the results of their actions.
```
Typically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the adventure, tracking the characters’
progress as they explore dungeon corridors or wilderness regions. The DM’s notes,
including a key to the map, describe what the adventurers find as they enter each new
area. Sometimes, the passage of time and the adventurers’ actions determine what
happens, so the DM might use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead
of a map.

## Time

In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the DM
determines the time a task requires. The DM might use a different time scale depending
on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers'
movement happens on a scale of minutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down
a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and
a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.

In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to


reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just
under four hours' time.

For long journeys, a scale of days works best. Following the starchart from Holy Terra to
an uncharted sector, the party spend four uneventful months before an eldar ambush
interrupts their journey.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a 6-second span
of time.

#### Movement

Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a
treacherous mountain slope--all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming
adventures.

The DM can summarize the adventurers' movement without calculating exact distances
or travel times: "You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the
evening of the third day." Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave
network, the DM can summarize movement between encounters: "After killing the
guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map,
which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow
stone arch."

Sometimes it's important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to
another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining
travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving
and the terrain they're moving over.

#### Speed

Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the
character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of
energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. The following rules
determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.

##### Travel Pace

While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as
shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period
of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less
perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area


more carefully.

**Forced March.** The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day.
They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance
shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution
saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a
failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.

**Mounts and Vehicles.** For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much
faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour,
covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to
10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in
densely populated areas.

Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal.
Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don't
suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the
vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.

Certain special mounts, such as a motorbike or griffon, or special vehicles allow you to

##### Difficult Terrain

The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads,
open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep
swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground--all considered
difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain--moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet
of speed--so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.


#### Special Types of Movement

Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than
simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where
they need to go.

##### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling

Each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain) when you’re
climbing, swimming, or crawling. You ignore this extra cost if you have a climbing speed
and use it to climb or a swimming speed and use it to swim. At the DM’s option,
climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful
Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a
successful Strength (Athletics) check.

##### Jumping

Your Strength determines how far you can jump.

**Long Jump.** When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your
Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When
you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each
foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a
stream or chasm. At your DM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics)
check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a
hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics)
check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

**High Jump.** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to
3 + your Strength modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least 10 feet on foot
immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only
half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of
movement. In some circumstances, your DM might allow you to make a Strength
(Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you
can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1 1/2 times your


height.

#### Activity While Traveling

As adventurers travel through a dungeon or the wilderness, they need to remain alert
for danger, and some characters might perform other tasks to help the group’s journey.

##### Marching Order

The adventurers should establish a marching order. A marching order makes it easier to
determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies,
and which ones are the closest to those enemies when a fight breaks out.

A character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle ranks, or the back rank.
Characters in the front and back ranks need enough room to travel side by side with
others in their rank. When space is too tight, the marching order must change, usually
by moving characters to a middle rank.

**Fewer Than Three Ranks.** If an adventuring party arranges its marching order with only
two ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If there’s only one rank, it’s considered
a front rank.

##### Stealth

While traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move stealthily. As long as they’re not
in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter. See the
rules for hiding in the Using Ability Scores section.

###### SPLITTING UP THE PARTY

Sometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party, especially if you want
one or more characters to scout ahead. You can form multiple parties, each moving at a
different speed. Each group has its own front, middle, and back ranks.

The drawback to this approach is that the party will be split into several smaller
groups in the event of an attack. The advantage is that a small group of stealthy
characters moving slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier characters
would alert. A pair of rogues moving at a slow pace are much harder to detect when
they leave their dwarf fighter friend behind.

##### Noticing Threats

Use the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the characters to determine whether


anyone in the group notices a hidden threat. The DM might decide that a threat can be
noticed only by characters in a particular rank. For example, as the characters are
exploring a maze of tunnels, the DM might decide that only those characters in the back
rank have a chance to hear or spot a stealthy creature following the group, while
characters in the front and middle ranks cannot.

While traveling at a fast pace, characters take a –5 penalty to their passive Wisdom
(Perception) scores to notice hidden threats.

**Encountering Creatures.** If the DM determines that the adventurers encounter other
creatures while they’re traveling, it’s up to both groups to decide what happens next.
Either group might decide to attack, initiate a conversation, run away, or wait to see
what the other group does.

**Surprising Foes.** If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or group, the DM
determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be surprised when combat
erupts. See the Combat section for more about surprise.

##### Other Activities

Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused
on watching for danger. These characters don’t contribute their passive Wisdom
(Perception) scores to the group’s chance of noticing hidden threats. However, a
character not watching for danger can do one of the following activities instead, or
some other activity with the DM’s permission.

**Navigate.** The character can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making a
Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide has
rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)

**Draw a Map.** The character can draw a map that records the group’s progress and helps
the characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability check is required.

**Track.** A character can follow the tracks of another creature, making a Wisdom
(Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules for
tracking.)

**Forage.** The character can keep an eye out for ready sources of food and water, making
a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide has
rules for foraging.)


## The Environment

By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full
of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important
ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.

#### Falling

A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At
the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 kinetic damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a
maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the
fall.

#### Radiation

For most intents and purposes, radiation is considered as poison damage or exhaustion
in smaller doses (such as extended UV radiation) and necrotic in large doses (such as a
weaponized radiation beam). Furthermore, radiation causes the poisoned condition in
surplus amounts, and can accumulate levels of exhaustion when found in the
environment.

A normal creature can survive normally in a mildly irradiated environment for a number
of days equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier. For a moderate level of radiation, this
duration is lowered to an amount of hours equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier. For
high levels of radiation, this duration is further lowered to an amount of minutes equal
to 1 + its Constitution modifier.

After a creature reaches its threshold for surviving radiation, it begins suffering
exhaustion. For every interval that passes, (such as a day for low levels of radiation or an
hour for medium levels of radiation) a creature in an irradiated area must make a DC 10
Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. Every consecutive time the
creature makes this Constitution saving throw, the DC is raised by 2.

A creature cannot lower exhaustion from a long rest while in an irradiated area.

#### Suffocating

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution
modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).


When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds
equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it
drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it
can breathe again.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it
starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.

#### Vacuum

Sometimes a creature is thrusted out into the vacuum of space. When this occurs, it
immediately begins suffocating unless it can survive normally in the vacuum of space or
has equipment to aid it.

An unprotected creature in the vacuum of space can survive a number of rounds equal
to 1 + its Constitution modifier while remaining conscious. At the start of its next turn, it
drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it is
protected from the vacuum of space and is able to breathe again.

## Vision and Light

The most fundamental tasks of exploring--noticing danger, finding hidden objects,
hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few--rely heavily on a
character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a
significant hindrance.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim
light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A heavily obscured area--such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage--blocks vision
entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition when trying to see
something in that area.

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of
illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as
do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.

**Dim light** , also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is


usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding
darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly
brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.

**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night
(even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean
vault, or in an area of enhanced darkness.

##### Blindsight

A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within
a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation
or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.

##### Darkvision

Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have
darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if
the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that
creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only
shades of gray.

##### Heatvision

Typically a trait found in predators and advanced technology, heatvision allows
someone to see the heat signatures given off by living bodies, fires, and explosions
outward to a specific range. Creatures with heatvision do not suffer penalties when
attempting to perceive heat-based creatures and objects within their heativision radius.
Creatures and objects can still benefit from being obscured from heatvision, such as by
hiding behind a vehicle. Heatvision cannot see through enhanced sources of darkness,
such as the _darkness_ spell, unless stated otherwise.

##### Truesight

A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and enhanced
darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and
succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a
shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by enhanced means.

Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.

## Food and Water


Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by
lack of food or water can't be removed until the character eats and drinks the full
required amount.

##### Food

A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by
subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day
without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her
Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a
character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion. A normal day of eating resets
the count of days without food to zero.

##### Water

A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is
hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15
Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A
character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at
the end of the day.

If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two
levels in either case.

## Interacting with Objects

A character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the
game. The player tells the DM that his or her character is doing something, such as
moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if anything, happens.

For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a
portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If
the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a
situation, the DM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can
wrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for any such check based on the
difficulty of the task.

Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune
to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and
enhanced attacks much like creatures can.


The DM determines an object's Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that
certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It's hard to cut a
rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws,
and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit
points, it breaks.

A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The DM sets the DC
for any such check.

## Social Interaction

Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying monsters are key parts of D&D
adventures. No less important, though, are the social interactions that adventurers have
with other inhabitants of the world.

Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous thief to
confess to some malfeasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that it will spare
your life. The DM assumes the roles of any characters who are participating in the
interaction that don’t belong to another player at the table. Any such character is called
a **nonplayer character** (NPC).

In general terms, an NPC’s attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or
hostile. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined to get
in your way. It’s easier to get what you want from a friendly NPC, of course.

Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.

## Roleplaying

Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it’s you as a player
determining how your character thinks, acts, and talks.

Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social
interactions. Your character’s quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how
interactions resolve.

There are two styles you can use when roleplaying your character: the descriptive
approach and the active approach. Most players use a combination of the two styles.


Use whichever mix of the two works best for you.

##### Descriptive Approach to Roleplaying

With this approach, you describe your character’s words and actions to the DM and the
other players. Drawing on your mental image of your character, you tell everyone what
your character does and how he or she does it.

For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek has a quick temper and blames the
elves of the Cloakwood for his family’s misfortune. At a tavern, an obnoxious elf
minstrel sits at Tordek’s table and tries to strike up a conversation with the dwarf.

Chris says, “Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult at the bard, and stomps over to
the bar. He sits on a stool and glares at the minstrel before ordering another drink.”

In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek’s mood and given the DM a clear idea of his
character’s attitude and actions.

When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind:

```
⦁ Describe your character’s emotions and attitude.
⦁ Focus on your character’s intent and how others might perceive it.
⦁ Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.
```
Don’t worry about getting things exactly right. Just focus on thinking about what your
character would do and describing what you see in your mind.

##### Active Approach to Roleplaying

If descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow players what your character
thinks and does, active roleplaying shows them.

When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character’s voice, like an actor
taking on a role. You might even echo your character’s movements and body language.
This approach is more immersive than descriptive roleplaying, though you still need to
describe things that can’t be reasonably acted out.

Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek above, here’s how the scene
might play out if Chris used active roleplaying:

Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, “I was wondering why it suddenly
smelled awful in here. If I wanted to hear anything out of you, I’d snap your arm and


enjoy your screams.” In his normal voice, Chris then adds, “I get up, glare at the elf, and
head to the bar.”

##### Results of Roleplaying

The DM uses your character’s actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A
cowardly NPC buckles under threats of violence. A stubborn dwarf refuses to let anyone
badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.

When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the DM’s portrayal of the NPC’s
mood, dialogue, and personality. You might be able to determine an NPC’s personality
traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on them to influence the NPC’s attitude.

Interactions in D&D are much like interactions in real life. If you can offer NPCs
something they want, threaten them with something they fear, or play on their
sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything you want. On the other
hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a noble’s allies, your efforts to convince
or deceive will fall short.

## Ability Checks

In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the outcome of an
interaction.

Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC’s attitude, but there might still be an element
of chance in the situation. For example, your DM can call for a Charisma check at any
point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice to play a role in determining an
NPC’s reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your DM’s
discretion.

Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact with
an NPC, and stack the deck in your favor by using an approach that relies on your best
bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a guard into letting them into a castle, the
rogue who is proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the discussion. When
negotiating for a hostage’s release, the cleric with Persuasion should do most of the
talking.

## Resting

Heroic though they might be, adventurers can't spend every hour of the day in the thick
of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest--time to sleep and eat,


tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves
for further adventure.

Adventurers, as well as other creatures, can take short rests in the midst of a day and a
long rest to end it.

#### Short Rest

A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does
nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the
character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. For
each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's
Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total (minimum
of 0). The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character
regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.

#### Long Rest

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a
character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity,
such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. If the rest is interrupted by a period
of strenuous activity - at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar
adventuring activity - the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from
it.

At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also
regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total
number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he
or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.

A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a
character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

## Between Adventures

Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to
rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this
time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or
spending their hard-earned gold.


In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or
description. When starting a new adventure, the DM might simply declare that a certain
amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your
character has been doing. At other times, the DM might want to keep track of just how
much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.

#### Lifestyle Expenses

Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of
maintaining that lifestyle.

Living a particular lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your character, but your
lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example,
when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles
of the city than if you live in poverty.

#### Downtime Activities

Between adventures, the DM might ask you what your character is doing during his or
her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity
requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least
8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The
days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of
days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch
to a new downtime activity.

Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your
character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss
it with your DM.

##### Crafting

You can craft nonenhanced objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art.
You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically
artisan's tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to
create it. For example, someone proficient with smith's tools needs a forge in order to
craft a sword or suit of armor.

For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a
total market value not exceeding 50 g, and you must expend raw materials worth half
the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than


50 g, you make progress every day in 50-g increments until you reach the market value
of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 15,000 g) takes 300 days to
craft by yourself.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item,
provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are
working together in the same place. Each character contributes 50 g worth of effort for
every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the
requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100
days, at a total cost of 7,500 g.

While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 10 g per day,
or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.

##### Practicing a Profession

You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without
having to pay 10 g per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your
profession.

If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a
temple or a thieves' guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.

If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use
during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.

##### Recuperating

You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury,
disease, or poison.

After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:

```
⦁ End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.
⦁ For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or
poison currently affecting you.
```
##### Researching

The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into
mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include


poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals
to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.

When you begin your research, the DM determines whether the information is
available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any
restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or
location). The DM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an
Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek,
or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are
met, you learn the information if it is available.

For each day of research, you must spend 10 g to cover your expenses. This cost is in
addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.

##### Training

You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set
of tools. Your DM might allow additional training options.

First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The DM determines how long it
takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.

The training lasts for 250 days and costs 10 g per day. After you spend the requisite
amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the
new tool.


# Chapter 9: Combat

The clatter of a sword striking against a shield. The terrible rending sound as monstrous
claws tear through armor. A brilliant flash of light as a ball of flame blossoms from a
techie’s spell. The sharp tang of blood in the air, cutting through the stench of vile
monsters. Roars of fury, shouts of triumph, cries of pain. Combat in D&D can be chaotic,
deadly, and thrilling.

This section provides the rules you need for your characters and monsters to engage in
combat, whether it is a brief skirmish or an extended conflict in a dungeon or on a field
of battle. Throughout this section, the rules address you, the player or Dungeon Master.
The Dungeon Master controls all the monsters and nonplayer characters involved in
combat, and each other player controls an adventurer. “You” can also mean the
character or monster that you control.

## The Order of Combat

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings,
feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into
a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world.
During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is
determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative.
Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has
defeated the other.

```
COMBAT STEP-BY-STEP
⦁ Determine surprise. The DM determines whether anyone involved in the combat
encounter is surprised.
⦁ Establish positions. The DM decides where all the characters and monsters are
located. Given the adventurers' marching order or their stated positions in the
room or other location, the DM figures out where the adversaries are--how far
away and in what direction.
⦁ Roll initiative. Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative,
determining the order of combatants' turns.
⦁ Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.
⦁ Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the
round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.
```

#### Surprise

A band of bounty hunters sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to
attack them. A warp beast glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the
adventurers until the beast engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the
battle gains surprise over the other.

The DM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they
automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the Dexterity (Stealth)
checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on
the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at
the start of the encounter.

If you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat,
and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised
even if the other members aren't.

#### Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every
participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The
DM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the
group acts at the same time.

The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check
total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which
they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied DM-controlled creatures, and the
players decide the order among their tied characters. The DM can decide the order if
the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the DM can have the
tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going
first.

#### Your Turn

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You
decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed--sometimes called
your walking speed--is noted on your character sheet.


The most common actions you can take are described in the Actions in Combat section.
Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.

The _Movement and Position_ section gives the rules for your move.

You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't
decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described
in "Actions in Combat."

##### Bonus Actions

Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on
your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue
to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or
other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You
otherwise don't have a bonus action to take.

You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus
action to use when you have more than one available.

You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's
timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also
prevents you from taking a bonus action.

##### Other Activity on Your Turn

Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your
move.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as
you take your turn.

You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during
either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move
as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action
you use to attack.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some
enhanced items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in
their descriptions.

The DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs


special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could
reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a
drawbridge.

##### Reactions

Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a
reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on
your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack, described later in this section, is
the most common type of reaction.

When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If
the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right
after the reaction.

## Movement and Position

In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and
position to gain the upper hand.

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little
of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of
movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move.
However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your
speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

#### Breaking Up Your Move

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and
after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet,
take your action, and then move 20 feet.

##### Moving Between Attacks

If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your
movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who
can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet
could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.


##### Using Different Speeds

If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you
can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you
switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result
determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the
new speed during the current move.

For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a techie cast the
_fly_ spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly
30 feet more.

#### Difficult Terrain

Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn
caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases--the setting of a typical fight
contains difficult terrain.

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if
multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples
of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as
difficult terrain.

#### Being Prone

Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked
down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone. You can
drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so
costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30
feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't
have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must crawl or use spells such as _teleportation_. Every foot of
movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain,
therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.

**INTERACTING WITH OBJECTS AROUND YOU**
Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your
movement and action:


```
⦁ draw or sheathe a sword
⦁ open or close a door
⦁ withdraw a potion from your backpack
⦁ pick up a dropped axe
⦁ take a bauble from a table
⦁ remove a ring from your finger
⦁ stuff some food into your mouth
⦁ plant a banner in the ground
⦁ fish a few coins from your belt pouch
⦁ drink all the ale in a flagon
⦁ throw a lever or a switch
⦁ pull a torch from a sconce
⦁ take a book from a shelf you can reach
⦁ extinguish a small flame
⦁ don a mask
⦁ pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head
⦁ put your ear to a door
⦁ kick a small stone
⦁ turn a key in a lock
⦁ tap the floor with a 10-foot pole
⦁ hand an item to another character
```
#### Moving Around Other Creatures

You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through
a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than
you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its
space.

If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity
attack, as explained later in the section.

#### Flying Movement

Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the
danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is
otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to


hover or it is being held aloft by enhanced means, such as by the _fly_ spell.

#### Creature Size

Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows
how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes
use the same size categories.

##### Size Categories

```
Size Space
Tiny 2 ½ by 2 ½ ft.
Small 5 by 5 ft.
Medium 5 by 5 ft.
Large 10 by 10 ft.
Huge 15 by 15 ft.
Gargantuan 20 by 20 ft. or larger
```
##### Space

A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an
expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for
example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium ork stands in a 5-foot-wide
doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the ork lets them.

A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason,
there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in
combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around
another one.

Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If
four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for
anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a
Gargantuan one.

##### Squeezing into a Smaller Space

A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size
smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet
wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every
foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws.
Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.


###### VARIANT: PLAYING ON A GRID

If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow
these rules.
**_Squares._** Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.

**_Speed._** Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid. This means
you use your speed in 5-foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your
speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, a speed of 30 feet translates
into a speed of 6 squares.

If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in squares on your character sheet.

**_Entering a Square._** To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement left,
even if the square is diagonally adjacent to the square you’re in. (The rule for diagonal
movement sacrifices realism for the sake of smooth play. The Dungeon Master’s Guide
provides guidance on using a more realistic approach.)

If a square costs extra movement, as a square of difficult terrain does, you must have
enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2
squares of movement left to enter a square of difficult terrain.

**_Corners._** Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain
feature that fills its space.

**_Ranges._** To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or
objects—start counting squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop
counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.

## Actions in Combat

When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented
here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you
improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you
whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to
determine success or failure.

#### Attack


The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are
swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.

With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the "Making an Attack"
section for the rules that govern attacks.

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more
than one attack with this action.

#### Cast a Spell

Psycasters and techcasters such as savants and psykers, as well as many monsters, have
access to powers and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting
time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or
even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most
spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in
combat to cast such a spell.

#### Dash

When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The
increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for
example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.

Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same
amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to
30 feet this turn if you dash.

#### Disengage

If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks
for the rest of the turn.

#### Dodge

When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start
of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the
attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if
you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.


#### Help

You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take
the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes
to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the
start of your next turn.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you.
You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack
more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is
made with advantage.

#### Hide

When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to
hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as
described in the "Unseen Attackers and Targets" section later in this section.

#### Ready

Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance
before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act
using your reaction before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you
choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to
your speed in response to it. Examples include "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll
pull the lever that opens it," and "If the goblin steps next to me, I move away."

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes
or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.

When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release
with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting
time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's power requires concentration. If your
concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you
are concentrating on the _web_ spell and ready _homing missile_ , your web spell ends, and if
you take damage before you release _homing missile_ with your reaction, your
concentration might be broken.


#### Search

When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something.
Depending on the nature of your search, the DM might have you make a Wisdom
(Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

#### Use an Object

You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you
draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you
take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with
more than one object on your turn.

**IMPROVISING AN ACTION**
Your character can do things not covered by the actions in this section, such as breaking
down doors, intimidating enemies, sensing weaknesses in enhanced defenses, or calling
for a parley with a foe. The only limits to the actions you can attempt are your
imagination and your character’s ability scores. See the descriptions of the ability scores
in the Using Ability Scores section for inspiration as you improvise.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you
whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to
determine success or failure.

## Making an Attack

Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an
attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.

1. **Choose a target.** Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a
location.
2. **Determine modifiers.** The DM determines whether the target has cover and whether
you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special
abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.
3. **Resolve the attack.** You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the
particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in
addition to or instead of damage.


If there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the
rule is simple: if you're making an attack roll, you're making an attack.

#### Attack Rolls

When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or
misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total
of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits.
The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster
is in its stat block.

##### Modifiers to the Roll

When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are
an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an
attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.

**Ability Modifier.** The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and
the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have
the finesse or thrown property break this rule.

Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack
depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.

**Proficiency Bonus.** You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack
using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a
spell.

##### Rolling 1 or 20

Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran
to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the
target's AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this section.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the
target's AC.

#### Unseen Attackers and Targets

Combatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting the invisibility


power, or lurking in darkness.

When you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll.
This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature
you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you
automatically miss, but the DM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether
you guessed the target's location correctly.

When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are
hidden--both unseen and unheard--when you make an attack, you give away your
location when the attack hits or misses.

#### Ranged Attacks

When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or
otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines
from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.

##### Range

You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.

If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a
target beyond this range.

Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two
ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long
range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and
you can't attack a target beyond the long range.

##### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat

Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a
ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on
the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who
isn't incapacitated.

#### Melee Attacks

Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your
reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer,
or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns,


teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.

Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them
when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium)
have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed
strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as
weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals kinetic damage equal to 1 + your Strength
modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.

##### Opportunity Attacks

In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing
or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.

You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out
of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one
melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature
leaves your reach.

You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also
don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something
moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don't
provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if gravity
causes you to fall past an enemy.

##### Two-Weapon Fighting

When you take the Attack action and attack with a light weapon that you're holding in
one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light weapon that you're
holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the
bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.

If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making
a melee attack with it.

**CONTESTS IN COMBAT**
Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is
represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require
an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The DM can use these contests
as models for improvising others.


##### Grappling

When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to
make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the
Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be
within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a
grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the
target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the
ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed,
you subject the target to the grappled condition. The condition specifies the things that
end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

**Escaping a Grapple.** A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must
succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your
Strength (Athletics) check.

**Moving a Grappled Creature.** When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled
creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes
smaller than you.

##### Shoving a Creature

Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either
to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you're able to make multiple attacks with
the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your
reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested
by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses
the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you
succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.

## Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a
target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or
other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the


most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For
example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives
three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

#### Half Cover

A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has
half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall,
a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an
enemy or a friend.

#### Three-Quarters Cover

A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A
target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle.
The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

#### Total Cover

A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some
spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover
if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.

## Damage and Healing

Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy
gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a
fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.

#### Hit Points

Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and
luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points
are more fragile.

A creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from
the creature's hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a
creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The
loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0


hit points.

#### Damage Rolls

Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll
the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target.
Enhanced weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage.

With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.

When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier--the same modifier used
for the attack roll--to the damage. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and
whether to add any modifiers.

If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll the
damage once for all of them. For example, when a techie casts _fireball_ or a psyker casts
_flame strike_ , the spell's damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.

##### Critical Hits

When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against
the target. Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add
any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at
once.

For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather
than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other
damage dice, such as from the rogue's Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as
well.

#### Damage Types

Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of
damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage
resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types follow, with examples to help a DM assign a damage type to a new
effect.

**Acid.** The corrosive spray of a plasma weapon and the dissolving enzymes secreted by
some tyranids deal acid damage.


**Cold.** The freezing temperature inside of a cryostasis chamber and psychic spells such as
_ice storm_ deal cold damage.

**Energy.** Energy damage, dealt by a guardsman’s lasgun or an inquisitor’s power sword,
sears the flesh like fire.

**Fire.** Flamers and many spells like _fire bolt_ use flames to deal fire damage.

**Force.** Force is pure enhanced energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that
deal force damage are spells, including _psychic missile_ and _baneful force_ ; high levels of
technology such as Tau pulse weapons deal force damage.

**Kinetic.** Kinetic damage represents attack that make physical contact, such as the
bludgeoning effects of a hammer, the slashing motion of a longsword, or the piercing
effects carried by daggers.

**Lightning.** A _lightning bolt_ spell and some railguns deal lightning damage.

**Necrotic.** Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as _chill touch_ or
large doses of radiation, withers matter and even the soul.

**Poison.** Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a tyranid’s venomous maw deal poison
damage.

**Psychic.** Mental abilities such as a psionic blast and staring into the warp deal psychic
damage.

**Thunder.** A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the _thunderwave_ spell, deals
thunder damage.

#### Damage Resistance and Vulnerability

Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with
certain types of damage.

If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved
against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that
type is doubled against it.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For
example, a creature has resistance to kinetic damage and is hit by an attack that deals


25 kinetic damage. The creature is also within a psychic aura that reduces all damage by

5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10
damage.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count
as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as
resistance to all nonenhanced damage, the damage of a nonehanced fire is reduced by
half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.

#### Healing

Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even death is reversible through
powerful spells, pacts, and artifacts. Rest can restore a creature's hit points, and psychic
methods such as a cure wounds spell or a medpac can remove damage in an instant.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its
current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit
points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a psyker grants a courser
8 hit points of healing. If the courser has 14 current hit points and has a hit point
maximum of 20, the courser regains 6 hit points from the psyker, not 8.

A creature that has died can't regain hit points until enhanced means such as the _revivify_
spell has restored it to life.

#### Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained
in the following sections.

##### Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and
there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit
point maximum.

For example, a psyker with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she
takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains.
Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the psyker dies.

##### Falling Unconscious

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious. This


unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.

##### Death Saving Throws

Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw,
called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang
onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in
the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of
succeeding on a saving throw.

**Roll a d20.** If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or
failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On
your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep
track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when
you regain any hit points or become stable.

**Rolling 1 or 20.** When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts
as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.

**Damage at 0 Hit Points.** If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a
death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures
instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant
death.

##### Stabilizing a Creature

The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable,
the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving
throw.

You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt
to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

A stable creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but
it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making
death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn't healed
regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.

##### Monsters and Death

Most DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it
fall unconscious and make death saving throws.


Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the DM might
have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.

#### Knocking a Creature Out

Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow.
When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker
can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is
dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.

#### Temporary Hit Points

Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary
hit points aren't actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points
that protect you from injury.

When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost
first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you
have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and
then take 2 damage.

Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed
your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive
temporary hit points.

Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you
have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the
ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary
hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to
consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you're
in that state, but only true healing can save you.

Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until
they're depleted or you finish a long rest.

#### Mounted Combat

A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a techie casting spells from the back of a
griffon, or a psyker soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed


and mobility that a mount can provide.

A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate
anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.

#### Mounting and Dismounting

Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or
dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For
example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a
horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if
your speed is 0.

If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a
DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet
of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.

If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and
land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet
of it.

#### Controlling a Mount

While you’re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow
it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.

You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated
horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative
of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you
direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled
mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.

An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no
restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It
might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act
against your wishes.

In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the
attacker can target you or the mount.


## Underwater Combat

When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an
ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a
challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.

When making a melee weapon attack, a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed
(either natural or granted by a power) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the
weapon is a dagger or spear.

A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal
range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless
the weapon is a thrown weapon (such as a javelin) or deals energy damage.

Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.


# Chapter 10: Psycasting, Techcasting

This chapter provides the rules for casting two types of powers: those granted by
technology, and those granted by the warp and psychic prowess.While multiple classes
use the warp or technology to fuel their powers, these are the only two sources.
Regardless, powers follow the rules here.

## What is a Power?

A power is a discrete effect, a single shaping of the energies of the warp or a result of a
technological formula, that creates a desired effect. In casting a power, a character
constructs the desired effect using the source of their power, and then releases it, all in
the span of seconds.

Powers can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or
undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix A), drain life energy away, and
restore life to the dead.

A great number of powers exist, and over time many have been created and forgotten.
An ancient piece of archaeotech may reveal ancient technology lost to the ravages of
time, or an ancient psychic power may be revealed through a piece of eldar literature.

## Power Level

Every power has a level from 0 to 9. A power’s level is a general indicator of how
powerful it is, with the lowly _charm person_ at 1st level and the powerful _invoke death_ at
9th. At-will powers—simple but effective powers that characters can cast almost by
rote—are level 0. The higher a power’s level, the higher level a psycaster or techcaster
must be to use that power.

Power level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to
be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level power.

## Known Powers

Before a psycaster or techcaster can use a power, he or she must have the power
learned, or must have access to the power in an enhanced item. Once a power is
learned, it is always prepared. The number of powers a caster can have at any given
time depends on the character’s level.


When you learn a power, either an at-will, 1st-level, or higher, you choose from the list
of powers provided in Chapters 11 and 11.1. You can learn powers from any level up to
your Max Power Level, including at-will powers. The total number of powers you learn
in this way can’t exceed your Psychic or Tech Powers Known for your class.

If a power is granted to you by a class feature, that power does not count against your
powers known and you can’t voluntarily unlearn it. If you already know that power, you
may learn an additional power that is available to you.

Additionally, every time you learn a new power as a result of gaining a level, you can
choose one of the powers you know and replace it with another power of the same
type, as long as that power is not of a higher level than your Max Power Level.

#### Psyker Points & Tech Points

Regardless of how many powers a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a
limited number of powers before resting. Manipulating the warp and channeling its
energy into even a simple power is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level
powers are even more so. Thus, each casting class’s description includes a table showing
how many force or tech points a character can use at each character level. For example,
the 3rd-level psyker Augustus has 12 psyker points.

When a character casts a power, he or she expends a number of points based on the
level of the power to create the slot to cast it. At-will powers always cost 0 points, while
casting a power at any other level costs the power level + 1 points, as shown in the
Power Level Point Cost table below. When Augustus casts _seal wounds_ , a 1st-level
power, he spends two of his 12 psyker points, leaving 10 remaining.

Finishing a long rest restores any expended psyker or tech points (see chapter 8 for the
rules on resting).

```
Power Level Point Cost
0 0
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
```

###### 5 6

###### 6 7

###### 7 8

###### 8 9

###### 9 10

#### Casting a Power at a Higher Level

When a caster casts a power using at a higher level than the power’s normal level, the
power assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Augustus casts _seal
wounds_ at 2nd-level, he uses three psyker points and that _seal wounds_ is 2nd level.

Many powers have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as indicated in the
**_At Higher Levels_** sections of the power’s description

##### Casting in Armor

Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for psycasting and
techcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a power. You
are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for psycasting and
techcasting.

#### At-Will Powers

An at-will power is one that can be cast without expending psyker or tech points.
Repeated practice has fixed the power in the caster’s mind. An at-will power’s level is 0.

#### Casting a Power

When a character casts any power, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the
character’s class or the power’s effects.

Each power description in chapters 11 and 11.1 begins with a block of information,
including the power’s name, level, casting time, range, and duration. The rest of a power
entry describes the power’s effect.

#### Casting Time

Most powers require a single action to cast, but some powers require a bonus action, a


reaction, or much more time to cast.

##### Bonus Action

A power cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on
your turn to cast the power, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this
turn. You can’t cast another power during the same turn, except for an at-will with a
casting time of 1 action.

##### Reactions

Some powers can be cast as reactions. These powers take a fraction of a second to bring
about and are cast in response to some event. If a power can be cast as a reaction, the
power’s description tells you exactly when you can do so.

##### Longer Casting Times

Certain powers require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a
power with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your
action each turn casting the power, and you must maintain your concentration while
you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken, the power fails,
but you don’t expend psyker or tech points. If you want to try casting the power again,
you must start over.

#### Range

The target of a power must be within the power’s range. For a power like _smite_ , the
target is a creature. For a power like _fireball_ , the target is the point in space where the
explosion occurs.

Most powers have ranges expressed in feet. Some power can target only a creature
(including you) that you touch. Other powers, such as the _invisibility_ power, affect only
you. These powers have a range of self.

Powers that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of
self, indicating that the origin point of the power’s effect must be you (see “Areas of
Effect” later in this chapter).

Once a power is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the power’s
description says otherwise.


#### Duration

A power’s duration is the length of time the power persists. A duration can be expressed
in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some powers specify that their effects last
until the powers are dispelled or destroyed.

##### Instantaneous

Many powers are instantaneous. The power harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature
or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its effect exists only for an instant.

##### Concentration

Some powers require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their effect active.
If you lose concentration, such a power ends.

If a power must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration
entry, and the power specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end
concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The
following factors can break concentration:

```
⦁ Casting another power that requires concentration. You lose concentration on a
power if you cast another power that requires concentration. You can’t
concentrate on two powers at once.
⦁ Taking damage. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a
power, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your
concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number
is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as a sniper rifle shot
and a psychic power, you make a separate saving throw for each source of
damage.
⦁ Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration on a power if you are
incapacitated or if you die.
```
The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as turbulence
on a ship or rocky terrain in a vehicle, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution
saving throw to maintain concentration on a power.


#### Targets

A typical power requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the power’s
effect. A power’s description tells you whether the power targets creatures, objects, or
a point of origin for an area of effect (described below). Unless a power has a
perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a power at all. An effect
like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a
creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a power says otherwise.

#### A Clear Path to the Target

To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.

If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a
wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near
side of that obstruction.

#### Targeting Yourself

If a power targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the
creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area
of effect of a power you cast, you can target yourself.

#### Areas of Effect

Powers such as _fireball_ and _lightning surge_ cover an area, allowing them to affect
multiple creatures at once.

A power’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different
shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a
location from which the power’s effect erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you
position its **point of origin**. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some
powers have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.

A power’s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked
straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that
location isn’t included in the power’s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an


obstruction must provide total cover, as explained in chapter 9.

##### Cone

A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone’s width at a
given point along its length is equal to that points distance from the point of origin. A
cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.

A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cones area of effect, unless you decide
otherwise.

##### Cube

You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The
cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side.

A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect, unless you decide
otherwise.

##### Cylinder

A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the
power description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the power
effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the
perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The power’s effect then shoots
up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.

A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of effect.

##### Line

A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an
area defined by its width.

A line's point of origin is not included in the line's area of effect, unless you decide
otherwise.


##### Sphere

You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point.
The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.

A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.

#### Saving Throws

Many powers specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a
power’s effects. The power specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and
what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your powers equals 8 + your psycasting or techcasting ability
modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.

#### Attack Rolls

Some powers require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the power
effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a power attack equals your
psycasting or techcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.

Most powers that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have
disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that
can see you and that isn’t incapacitated (see chapter 9).

#### Combining Enhanced Effects

The effects of different powers add together while the durations of those powers
overlap. The effects of the same power cast multiple times—or identical effects from
separate powers—don’t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect—such as
the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap.

For example, if two mechnicians cast _combat analysis_ on the same target, that character
gains the power’s benefit only once; he or she doesn't get to roll two bonus dice.

## Power Descriptions

#### A Powers

##### Alter Self

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
You assume a different form. When you cast the power, choose one of the following
options, the effects of which last for the duration of the power. While the power lasts,
you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.

**_Aquatic Adaptation._** You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and
growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a
swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

**_Change Appearance._** You transform your appearance by physically moulding yourself.
You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of
your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can
make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics
change. You also can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic


shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this power to become
quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the power, you can use your
action to change your appearance in this way again.

**_Natural Weapons._** You grow or power up your claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different
natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 kinetic damage, as
appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed
strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is enhanced and you have a +1 bonus to the attack
and damage rolls you make using it.

##### Arcane Eye

_4th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
You create an invisible, psychic eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.

You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and
darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction.

As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to
how far away from you the eye can move, but it can’t enter another plane of existence.
A solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as
small as 1 inch in diameter.

##### Augury

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 minute
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Instantaneous
By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling bones, reciting prayers, laying out tarot cards, or
employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from the immaterium by
peering into its many futures to determine the results of a specific course of action that
you plan to take within the next day. The DM chooses from the following possible
omens:

```
⦁ Boon , for results which will benefit you or your intentions.
⦁ Bane , for results which will harm you or your intentions.
⦁ Ruin , for results which are certain to end in death or tragedy of yourself or your
intentions.
```

```
⦁ Unclear , for results which are too difficult or too cloudy to discern.
⦁ Varied , for results which will both benefit and harm you or your intentions.
```
The power doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the
outcome, such as the casting of additional powers or the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the power two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is
a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random
reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.

##### Avert Warp

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Concentration up to 10 minutes
Until the power ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types
of creatures: aberrations, daemons, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on
attack rolls against the target. The target also can’t be charmed, frightened, or
possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a
creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

##### Banishing Ward

_4th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from creatures originating from beyond
realspace. For the duration, daemons, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls
against you.

You can end the power early by using either of the following special functions.

**_Break Enchantment._** As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that is
charmed, frightened, or possessed by a daemon or an undead. The creature you touch is
no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.

**_Dismissal._** As your action, make a melee psychic attack against a daemon or an undead
you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature into the immaterium. The


creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to the immaterium
(if it isn’t there already).

#### B Powers

##### Banishment

_4th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range into the immaterium.
The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.

If the target is already within the immaterium, you banish the target to a different
demiplane within the immaterium. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target
remains there until the power ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it
left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is in realspace, the target is banished, returning to the immaterium. If the
power ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in
the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn’t
return.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 5th level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each level above 4th.

##### Beacon of Hope

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
This power bestows hope and vitality. Choose any number of creatures within range. For
the duration, each target has advantage on Wisdom saving throws and death saving
throws, and regains the maximum number of hit points possible from any healing.

##### Beseech Warp Entity

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 10 minutes
**Range** : 60 feet


**Duration** : Instantaneous
You beseech an entity of substantial power for aid, such as a daemon prince or living
saint. A creature loyal to the entity appears in an unoccupied space within range, and
you can bargain for its services in exchange for payment. You can request a specific
creature to be sent to aid you if you know its name.

**_Aid._** The creature is under no compulsion to act in a certain way. Directions can range
from simple (help us in battle) to complex (spy on our enemies).

**_Payment._** In order to receive aid, you must provide payment. Creatures may desire
secrets, weapons, living sacrifices, or material wealth. Typically, a creature may demand
1,000 g per minute of service, 10,000 g per hour of service, or 100,000 g per day of
service. Simple or safe tasks may halve the payment, while dangerous tasks may double
the payment. Creatures rarely accept tasks that are suicidal or contrary to their motives.

After the creature completes the task or the duration of service expires, the creature
reports back to you before being sent back to the immaterium, if appropriate to the
task. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature’s service, the creature returns
to the immaterium instead of completing the task.

##### Bestow Curse

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
become cursed for the duration of the power. When you cast this power, choose the
nature of the curse from the following options:

```
⦁ Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability
checks and saving throws made with that ability score.
⦁ While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
⦁ While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each
of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.
⦁ While the target is cursed, your attacks and powers deal an extra 1d8 necrotic
damage to the target.
```
A _remove curse_ or _medicae major_ power ends this effect. At the DM’s option, you may
choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those
described above. The DM has final say on such a curse’s effect.


**_At Higher Levels._** If you cast this power at 4th level or higher, the duration is
concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you cast this power at 5th level or higher, the
duration is 8 hours. If you cast this power at 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours.
If you cast this power at 9th level, the power lasts until it is dispelled. Casting this power
at 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration.

##### Blade of Disaster

_9th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 bonus action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You manifest a blade-shaped portal to the immaterium about 3 feet long in an
unoccupied space you can see within range. The blade lasts for the duration. When you
cast this power, you can make up to two melee psychic attacks with the blade, each one
against a creature, loose object, or structure within 5 feet of the blade. On a hit, the
target takes 4d12 force damage. This attack scores a critical hit if the number on the d20
is 18 or higher. On a critical hit, the blade deals an extra 8d12 force damage (for a total
of 12d12 force damage).

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the blade up to 30 feet to an unoccupied
space you can see and then make up to two melee psychic attacks with it again.

The blade can harmlessly pass through any barrier, including a _wall of force_.

##### Blight

_4th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within
range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving
throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
on a successful one. This power has no effect on undead or constructs.

If you target a plant creature or an enhanced plant, it makes the saving throw with
disadvantage, and the power deals maximum damage to it.

If you target an enhanced plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn’t
make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.


**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 5th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d8 for each level above 4th.

##### Blindness/Deafness

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : 1 minute
You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see within range to
make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target is either blinded or deafened
(your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a
Constitution saving throw. On a success, the power ends.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 3rd level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each level above 2nd.

##### Blink

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : 1 minute
Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the power. On a roll of 11
or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the
immaterium (the power fails and the casting is wasted if you were already in the
immaterium). At the start of your next turn, and when the power ends if you are on the
immaterium, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within
10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that
range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one
space is equally near). You can dismiss this power as an action.

While on the immaterium, you can see and hear in realspace, and you can’t see
anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other
creatures on the immaterium. Creatures that aren’t there can’t perceive you or interact
with you, unless they have the ability to do so.

##### Burning Hands

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self (15-foot cone)


**Duration** : Instantaneous
As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames
shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must
make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half
as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d6 for each level above 1st.

#### C Powers

##### Call Lightning

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You conjure a minor cloud of warp energy above you. A 10-foot tall, 60-foot radius
storm cloud cylinder appears, centered on a point you can see within range above you,
with you as the center point. The power fails if your location can’t accommodate the
cloud’s size or height. When you cast the power, choose a point under the cloud for
lightning to strike. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius square must make a Dexterity
save, taking 3d10 lightning damage on a fail and half on a success. While the power
persists, you can use your action to call lightning to a point in range again.

If you’re outdoors and in a storm, the power gives you control of the storm rather than
creating a new one. The lightning damage also increases by 1d10.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d10 for each level above 3rd.

##### Chain Lightning

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 150 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of your choice that you can see
within range. Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three other targets,


each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or an
object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts.

A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d8 lightning damage on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 7th level or higher, one additional bolt
leaps from the first target to another target for each level above 6th.

##### Chaos Orb

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 90 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You hurl a 4-inch-diameter sphere of chaotic energy at a creature that you can see
within range. You choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder for the type of orb
you create, and then make a ranged psychic attack against the target. If the attack hits,
the creature takes 3d8 damage of the type you chose.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power using at 2nd level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d8 for each level above 1st.

##### Charm Monster

_4th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : 1 hour
You attempt to charm a creature you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom
saving throw, and it does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If
it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the power ends or until you or your
companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature is friendly to you. When
the power ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 5th level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of
each other when you target them.

##### Charm Person

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action


**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : 1 hour
You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom
saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it
fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the power ends or until you or your
companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly
acquaintance. When the power ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of
each other when you target them.

##### Circle of Death

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 150 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
A sphere of negative energy ripples out in a 60-foot-radius sphere from a point within
range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes
8d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 7th level or higher, the damage increases
by 2d6 for each level above 6th.

##### Circle of Power

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self (30-foot radius)
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Energy radiates from you, distorting and diffusing psychic energy within 30 feet of you.
Until the power ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you. For the duration,
each friendly creature in the area (including you) has advantage on saving throws
against powers and other enhanced effects. Additionally, when an affected creature
succeeds on a saving throw made against a power or enhanced effect that allows it to
make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds
on the saving throw.

##### Clairvoyance

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 10 minutes


**Range** : 1 mile
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have
visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind
a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the
duration, and it can’t be attacked or otherwise interacted with.

When you cast the power, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense
through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your action, you can switch between
seeing and hearing.

A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from see invisibility or
truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist.

##### Command

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : 1 round
You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The
power has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn’t understand your language, or if
your command is directly harmful to it.

Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than
one described here. If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If the
target can’t follow your command, the power ends.

**_Approach._** The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route,
ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.
**_Drop._** The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.
**_Flee._** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available
means.
**_Grovel._** The target falls prone and then ends its turn.
**_Halt._** The target doesn’t move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft,
provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum
distance needed to remain in the air.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, you can affect one
additional creature for each level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of
each other when you target them.


##### Commune

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 minute
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : 1 minute
You contact an otherworldly being or proxy residing within the immaterium, typically
one relating to your faith or situation (such as a daemon, living saint, or deceased battle-
brother), and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must
ask your questions before the power ends. You receive a correct answer for each
question.

Creatures within the immaterium aren’t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive
“unclear” as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the
creature’s knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or
contrary to the creature’s interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer
instead.

If you cast the power two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a
cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.
The DM makes this roll in secret.

##### Cone of Cold

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self (60-foot cone)
**Duration** : Instantaneous
A blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a
Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.

A creature killed by this power becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 6th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d8 for each level above 5th.

##### Contagion

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch


**Duration** : 7 days
Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee psychic attack against a creature within your
reach. On a hit, the target is poisoned.

At the end of each of the poisoned target's turns, the target must make a Constitution
saving throw. If the target succeeds on three of these saves, it is no longer poisoned,
and the power ends. If the target fails three of these saves, the target is no longer
poisoned, but choose one of the diseases below. The target is subjected to the chosen
disease for the power's duration.

Since this power induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a
disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects apply to it.

**_Blinding Sickness._** Pain grips the creature’s mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The
creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.
**_Filth Fever._** A raging fever sweeps through the creature’s body. The creature has
disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use
Strength.
**_Flesh Rot._** The creature’s flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma
checks and vulnerability to all damage.
**_Seizure._** The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on
Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.
**_Slimy Doom._** The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has
disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition,
whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.

##### Control Water

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 300 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Until the power ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that
is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects
when you cast this power. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or
choose a different one.

**_Flood._** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much
as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.
If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave
that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or
smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or


smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.
The water level remains elevated until the power ends or you choose a different
effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn
while the flood effect lasts.
**_Part Water._** You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The
trench extends across the power’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either
side. The trench remains until the power ends or you choose a different effect. The
water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal
water level is restored.
**_Redirect Flow._** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you
choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely
directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the
power’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues
to move in the direction you chose until the power ends or you choose a different
effect.
**_Whirlpool._** This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet
deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a
vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any
creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward
it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check
against your psychic save DC.
When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there,
it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 kinetic
damage and is caught in the vortex until the power ends. On a successful save, the
creature takes half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the
vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but
has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.
The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 kinetic
damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.

##### Control Weather

_8th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 10 minutes
**Range** : Self (5-mile radius)
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 8 hours
You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be
outdoors to cast this power. Moving to a place where you don’t have a clear path to the
sky ends the power early.

When you cast the power, you change the current weather conditions, which are
determined by the DM based on the climate and season. You can change precipitation,


temperature, and wind. It takes 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once
they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the power ends, the weather
gradually returns to normal.

When you change the weather conditions, find the current condition on the following
tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you can
change its direction.

```
Temperature Wind Precipitation
Stage Condition Stage Condition Stage Condition
1 Unbearable heat 1 Calm 1 Clear
2 Hot 2 Moderate Wind 2 Light Clouds
3 Warm 3 Strong Wind 3 Overcast or ground fog
4 Cool 4 Gale 4 Rain, hail, or snow
5 Cold 5 Storm 5 Torrential rain, driving hail, or blizzard
6 Arctic Cold — — — —
```
##### Crown of Madness

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the target is charmed
in this way, a twisted crown of jagged iron appears on its head, and a madness glows in
its eyes.

The charmed target must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make a
melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose. The target
can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature or if none are within its reach.

On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over the target,
or the power ends. Also, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each
of its turns. On a success, the power ends.

#### D Powers

##### Darkness


_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Psychic darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius
sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with
darkvision or heatvision can’t see through this darkness, and enhanced light can’t
illuminate it.

If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or
carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering
the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the
darkness.

If any of this power’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a power of 2nd level
or lower, the power that created the light is dispelled.

##### Darkvision

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 8 hours
You touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see in the dark. For the duration,
you give that creature darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

##### Dawn

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
The light of dawn shines down on a location you specify within range. Until the power
ends, a 30-foot-radius.40-foot-high cylinder of bright light glimmers there. This light is
sunlight. When the cylinder appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving
throw, taking 4d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw whenever it ends its turn in
the cylinder. If you’re within 60 feet of the cylinder, you can move it up to 60 feet as a
bonus action on your turn.

##### Demiplane

_8th-level power_


**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : 1 hour
You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. The
door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. When
opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in
each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the power ends, the door disappears,
and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door
also disappears from the other side.

Each time you cast this power, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy
door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this power.
Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of
this power by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its
demiplane instead.

##### Deny the Witch

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
For the duration, you or one willing creature you can see within range has resistance to
psionic damage, as well as advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving
throws.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each level above 3rd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of
each other when you target them.

##### Destructive Wave

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self (30-foot radius)
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You strike the ground, creating a burst of psychic energy that ripples outward from you.
Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving
throw or take 5d6 thunder damage, as well as 5d6 radiant or necrotic damage (your
choice), and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half
as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.


##### Detect Invisibility

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : 1 hour
For the duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible.

##### Detect Thoughts

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the
power and as your action on each turn until the power ends, you can focus your mind
on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose
has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is
unaffected.

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that
moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s
thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe
deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its
reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such
as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the power ends. Either way,
the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention
to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an
Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the power ends.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its
thoughts, so this power is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

You can also use this power to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see.
When you cast the power or as your action during the duration, you can search for
thoughts within 30 feet of you. The power can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2
inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect
a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.

Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the
rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be


within range.

##### Detect Warp

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
For the duration, you sense the presence of the immaterium within 30 feet of you.
Creatures that possess the psycasting feature, enhanced items that have psychic effects,
and creatures that are daemons and undead all appear with a faint, glowing aura
around them for the duration.

The power can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of
common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

##### Disintegrate

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within
range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of psychic force, such as the
wall created by _wall of force_.

A creature targeted by this power must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save,
the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. The target is disintegrated if this damage
leaves it with 0 hit points.

A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except enhanced
items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by
means of a _weave reality_ power

This power automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonenhanced object or a
creation of enhanced means. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force,
this power disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. An enhanced item is unaffected by
this power.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this at 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6
for each level above 6th.


##### Disrupt Warp

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
Choose one creature, object, or psychic effect within range. Any power of 3rd level or
lower on the target ends. For each power of 4th level or higher on the target, make an
ability check using your psycasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the power’s level. On a
successful check, the power ends.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, you automatically end
the effects of a power on the target if the power’s level is equal to or less than the level
of the power you used.

##### Dissonant Whispers

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can
hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if
available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn’t move
into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target
takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to move away. A deafened creature
automatically succeeds on the save.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d6 for each level above 1st.

##### Divination

_4th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Instantaneous
Your rituals and an offering put you in contact with a being from the immaterium, a
daemon, or equivalent. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or
activity to occur within 7 days. The creature offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a
short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.


The power doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the
outcome, such as the casting of additional powers or the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the power two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a
cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random
reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.

##### Divine Area

_4th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You search for the psychic signature of a creature or object. Reaching out with your
senses, you attempt to find a path to the creature’s or object’s location, as long as that
creature or object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature or object is moving, you
know the direction of its movement.

The power can locate a specific creature or object known to you, or the nearest
creature/object of a specific kind (such as a space marine or an eldar), so long as you
have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once.

##### Dominate Monster

_8th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
You attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within range. It must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that
are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

While the creature is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of
you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue
commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does
its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack
that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the
order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to
the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of


your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything
that you don’t allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a
reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the
power. If the saving throw succeeds, the power ends.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 9th-level, the duration is concentration,
up to 8 hours.

##### Dominate Person

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that
are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you
are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands
to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to
obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that
creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order
and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the
best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of
your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything
that you don’t allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a
reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the
power. If the saving throw succeeds, the power ends.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 6th-level, the duration is concentration,
up to 10 minutes. When you cast this power at 7th-level, the duration is concentration,
up to 1 hour. When you cast this power at 8th level or higher, the duration is
concentration, up to 8 hours.


#### E Powers

##### Earthquake

_8th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 500 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range.
For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle
centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground
in that area.

The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is
concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s
concentration is broken.

When you cast this power and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it,
each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature is knocked prone.

This power can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as
determined by the DM.

Fissures. Fissures open throughout the power’s area at the start of your next turn after
you cast the power. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM.
Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the power’s
area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must
succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves
with the fissure’s edge as it opens.

A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).

**_Structures._** The tremor deals 50 kinetic damage to any structure in contact with the
ground in the area when you cast the power and at the start of each of your turns until
the power ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages
nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make
a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 kinetic damage, is
knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check
as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the


nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and
doesn’t fall prone or become buried.

##### Embolden

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
A willing creature you touch has doubt cast from their mind. Until the power ends, the
creature is immune to being frightened and gains temporary hit points equal to your
psycasting ability modifier at the start of each of its turns. When the power ends, the
target loses any remaining temporary hit points from this power.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each level above 1st.

##### Eldritch Spears

_7th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : 1 hour
Seven spears of eldritch energy appear and orbit your head until the power ends. You
can use a bonus action to send one of the motes streaking toward one creature or
object within 120 feet of you. When you do so, make a ranged psychic attack. On a hit,
the target takes 4d12 force damage. Whether you hit or miss, the spear is expended.
The power ends early if you expend the spear.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 8th level or higher, the number of spears
created increases by two for each level above 7th.

##### Enhance Ability

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
You touch a creature and bestow upon it a psychic enhancement. Choose one of the
following effects; the target gains that effect until the power ends.

**_Unyielding Endurance._** The target has advantage on Constitution checks. It also
gains 2d6 temporary hit points, which are lost when the power ends.


**_Overpowering Strength._** The target has advantage on Strength checks, and his or
her carrying capacity doubles.
**_Lithe Grace._** The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn’t take
damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn’t incapacitated.
**_Radiating Splendor._** The target has advantage on Charisma checks.
**_Wily Cunning._** The target has advantage on Intelligence checks.
**_Unerring Wisdom._** The target has advantage on Wisdom checks.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 3rd level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each level above 2nd.

##### Enhance Weapon

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 bonus action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
You touch a nonenhanced weapon. Until the power ends, that weapon becomes an
enhanced weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, the bonus increases
to +2. When you cast this power at 6th level or higher, the bonus increases to +3.

##### Enlarge/Reduce

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for
the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If
the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the power
has no effect.

If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any
item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.

**_Enlarge._** The target’s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight.
This growth increases its size by one category—from Medium to Large, for example. If
there isn’t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains
the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the power ends, the target also
has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons


also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks
with them deal 1d4 extra damage.

**_Reduce._** The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-
eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category—from Medium to
Small, for example. Until the power ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength
checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also shrink to match its new
size. While these weapons are reduced, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 less
damage (this can’t reduce the damage below 1).

##### Etherealness

_7th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Up to 8 hours
You step into the border regions of the immaterium, in the area where it overlaps with
realspace. You remain between the immaterium and realspace for the duration, or until
you use your action to dismiss the power. During this time, you can move in any
direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can
see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and you
can’t see anything more than 60 feet away.

While within the immaterium, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures of
that plane. Creatures that aren’t in the immaterium can’t perceive you and can’t
interact with you, unless a special ability or power has given them the ability to do so.

You ignore all objects that aren’t within the immaterium, allowing you to move through
objects you perceive in realspace. When the power ends, you immediately return to
realspace in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object
or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied
space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you
are moved.

This power has no effect if you cast it while you are already in the immaterium or in an
area that prevents planar travel.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 8th level or higher, you can target up to
three willing creatures (including you) for each level above 7th. The creatures must be
within 10 feet of you when you cast the power.


##### Eyebite

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
For the power’s duration, your eyes become an inky void imbued with dread power.
One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects of your choice for
the duration. On each of your turns until the power ends, you can use your action to
target another creature but can’t target a creature again if it has succeeded on a saving
throw against this casting of eyebite.

**_Asleep._** The target falls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another
creature uses its action to shake the sleeper awake.
**_Panicked._** The target is frightened of you. On each of its turns, the frightened
creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest and shortest
available route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place at least
60 feet away from you where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.
**_Sickened._** The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the end
of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect
ends.

#### F Powers

##### False Life

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : 1 hour
Bolstering yourself with a necromantic facsimile of life, you gain 1d4 + 4 temporary hit
points for the duration.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, you gain 5 additional
temporary hit points for each level above 1st.

##### Fear

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action


**Range** : Self (30-foot cone)
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You project a phantasmal image of a creature’s worst fears. Each creature in a 30-foot
cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and
become frightened for the duration.

While frightened by this power, a creature must take the Dash action and move away
from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to
move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to
you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the power
ends for that creature.

##### Feign Death

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 1 hour
You touch a willing creature and put it into a cataleptic state that is indistinguishable
from death.

For the power’s duration, or until you use an action to touch the target and dismiss the
power, the target appears dead to all outward inspection and to powers used to
determine the target’s status. The target is blinded and incapacitated, and its speed
drops to 0. The target has resistance to all damage except psychic damage. If the target
is diseased or poisoned when you cast the power, or becomes diseased or poisoned
while under the power’s effect, the disease and poison have no effect until the power
ends.

##### Finger of Death

_7th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range,
causing it searing pain. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 7d8 +
30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A humanoid killed by this power rises at the start of your next turn as a zombie that is
permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its
ability.


##### Fire Bolt

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged psychic
attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage. A flammable
object hit by this power ignites if it isn’t being worn or carried.

This power’s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level
(3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

##### Fire Storm

_7th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 150 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
A storm made up of sheets of roaring flame appears in a location you choose within
range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange
as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube.
Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d10 fire damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being
worn or carried. If you choose, plant life in the area is unaffected by this power.

##### Fireball

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 150 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and
then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-
radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes
8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t
being worn or carried.


**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d6 for each level above 3rd.

##### Flame Blade

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 bonus action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a
scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you
can evoke the blade again as a bonus action.

You can use your action to make a melee psychic attack with the fiery blade. On a hit,
the target takes 3d6 fire damage.

The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10
feet.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d6 for every two levels above 2nd.

##### Flame Strike

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
A vertical column of fire roars down from the heavens in a location you specify. Each
creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range
must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 radiant
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 6th level or higher, the fire damage or
the energy damage (your choice) increases by 1d6 for each level above 5th.

##### Flaming Sphere

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within


range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the
sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a
creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere’s damage, and
the sphere stops moving this turn.

When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it
across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or
carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20
feet.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 3rd level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d6 for each level above 2nd.

##### Fly

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration.
When the power ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each level above 3rd.

##### Forbiddance

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 10 minutes
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 1 day
You create a ward against enhanced travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of
floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can’t
teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the _psygate_ power, to
enter the area. The power proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents
creatures from accessing the area by way of the immaterium, the webway, or the _plane
shift_ power.

In addition, this power damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it.


Choose one or more of the following: daemons or undead. When a chosen creature
enters the power’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature
takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this power).

When you cast this power, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the
password as it enters the area takes no damage from the power.

The power’s area can’t overlap with the area of another _forbiddance_ power. If you cast
_forbiddance_ every day for 30 days in the same location, the power lasts until it is
dispelled, and you require at least 10,000 g worth of rare incense and holy or unholy
water, which the power consumes on the 30th day.

##### Foresight

_9th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 minute
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 8 hours
You touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into the immediate
future. For the duration, the target can’t be surprised and has advantage on attack rolls,
ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, other creatures have disadvantage on
attack rolls against the target for the duration.

This power immediately ends if you cast it again before its duration ends.

##### Fracture Warp

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you
casting a psychic power
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a psychic power. If the
creature is casting a power of 3rd level or lower, its power fails and has no effect. If it is
casting a power of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your psycasting
ability. The DC equals 10 + the power’s level. On a success, the creature’s power fails
and has no effect.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, the interrupted
power has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the power you used.


#### G Powers

##### Gate of Infinity

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 500 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create linked teleportation portals via psychic power or teleportation pads that
remain open for the duration. Choose two points on the ground that you can see, one
point within 10 feet of you and one point within 500 feet of you. A circular portal, 10
feet in diameter, opens over each point. If the portal would open in the space occupied
by a creature, the power fails, and the casting is lost.

The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled with mist, hovering inches from the
ground and perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is visible only from one
side (your choice), which is the side that functions as a portal.

Any creature or object entering the portal exits from the other portal as if the two were
adjacent to each other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side has no effect.
The mist that fills each portal is opaque and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you
can rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side faces in a different
direction.

##### Geas

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 minute
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : 30 days
You place a psychic command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to
carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If
the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10
psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but
no more than once each day. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by the
power.

You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain
death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the power ends.


You can end the power early by using an action to dismiss it. A _remove curse_ , _greater
restoration_ , _medicae major_ , or _weave reality_ power also ends it.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year.
When you cast this power at 9th level, the power lasts until it is ended by one of the
powers mentioned above.

##### Glowing Wisps

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches,
lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the
four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form
you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot
within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this power, and a
light winks out if it exceeds the power’s range.

##### Greater Invisibility

_4th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the power ends. Anything the target
is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target’s person.

##### Greater Restoration

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You imbue a creature you touch with positive energy to undo a debilitating effect. You
can reduce the target’s exhaustion level by one, or end one of the following effects on
the target:

```
⦁ One effect that charmed or petrified the target
```

```
⦁ One curse, including the target’s attunement to dangerous technology or a
cursed item.
⦁ Any reduction to one of the target’s ability scores
⦁ One effect reducing the target’s hit point maximum
```
#### H Powers

##### Harm

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target
must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage,
or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can’t reduce the target’s hit
points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for
1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a
disease allows a creature’s hit point maximum to return to normal before that time
passes.

##### Heal

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
Choose a creature that you can see within range. A surge of positive energy washes
through the creature, causing it to regain 70 hit points. This power also ends blindness,
deafness, and any diseases affecting the target. This power has no effect on constructs
or undead.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 7th level or higher, the amount of healing
increases by 10 for each level above 6th.

##### Hellish Rebuke

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 reaction, which you take in response to being damaged by a creature
within 60 feet of you that you can see
**Range** : 60 feet


**Duration** : Instantaneous
You point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is momentarily surrounded by
hellish flames. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 2d10 fire
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d10 for each level above 1st.

##### Hold Monster

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 90 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. This power has no effect on undead. At
the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a
success, the power ends on the target.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 6th level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each level above 5th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of
each other when you target them.

##### Hold Person

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose a humanoid that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a

the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the power ends on the
target.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 3rd level or higher, you can target one
additional humanoid for each level above 2nd. The humanoids must be within 30 feet of
each other when you target them.

#### I Powers

##### Identify


_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 minute
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the power. If it is
an enhanced or modified item, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it
requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any
powers are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a power,
you learn which power created it.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what psychic powers, if
any, are currently affecting it.

##### Immolation

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 90 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. The target must make a
Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for the power’s
duration. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an
additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It
takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, and the power ends on a successful one. These
psychic flames can’t be extinguished through nonenhanced means.

If damage from this power reduces a target to 0 hit points, the target is turned to ash.

##### Invisibility

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
A creature you touch becomes invisible until the power ends. Anything the target is
wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target’s person. The power ends for
a target that attacks or casts a power.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 3rd level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each level above 2nd.


##### Invoke Death

_9th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die
instantly. If the creature you choose has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the
power has no effect.

##### Invoke Phenomena

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : Up to 1 minute
You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range. You create
one of the following psychic effects within range:

```
⦁ Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute.
⦁ You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.
⦁ You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.
⦁ You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice
within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous
whispers.
⦁ You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.
⦁ You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.
```
If you cast this power multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects
active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

#### L Powers

##### Lesser Restoration

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You touch a creature and can end either one nonenhanced disease or one condition


afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.

##### Levitate

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises
vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The power can
levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a
Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within
reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can
change the target’s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are
the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your
action to move the target, which must remain within the power’s range.

When the power ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.

#### M Powers

##### Maelstrom

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
A mass of 5-foot-deep water appears and swirls in a 30-foot radius centered on a point
you can see within range. The point must be on ground or in a body of water. Until the
power ends, that area is difficult terrain, and any creature that starts its turn there must
succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 6d6 kinetic damage and be pulled 10 feet
toward the center.

##### Magnus’s Meteor Storm

_9th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 1 mile
**Duration** : Instantaneous
Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within


range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must
make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes
20d6 fire damage and 20d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only
once.

The power damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being
worn or carried.

##### Malcador’s Scorcher

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
A line of roaring flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction
you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature
takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 3rd level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d8 for each level above 2nd.

##### Marabas’s Psychic Aura

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 24 hours
You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that powers reveal false
information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn’t being
carried or worn by another creature.

When you cast the power, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts
for the duration. If you cast this power on the same creature or object every day for 30
days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.

**_False Aura._** You change the way the target appears to powers and enhanced effects,
such as _detect enhancement_ and _detect warp_ , that detect auras. You can make a
nonenhanced object appear enhanced, or an enhanced object appear nonenhanced.
When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false enhancement apparent
to any creature that handles the item.


**_Mask._** You change the way the target appears to powers and enhanced effects that
detect creature types, such as an exorcist’s witch sight or the trigger of a _symbol_ power.
You choose a creature type and other powers and enhanced effects treat the target as if
it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.

##### Mass Seal Wounds

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose
up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains
hit points equal to 3d8 + your psycasting ability modifier. This power has no effect on
undead or constructs.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 6th level or higher, the healing increases
by 1d8 for each level above 5th.

##### Mass Stitch Flesh

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 bonus action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You use thread-like needles of warp energy to stitch together flesh. Up to six creatures
of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your
psycasting ability modifier. This power has no effect on undead or constructs.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, the healing increases
by 1d4 for each level above 3rd.

#### M Powers

##### Mask of the Deceiver

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : 1 hour
You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on
your person—look different until the power ends or until you use your action to dismiss


it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You
can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic
arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this power fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if
you use this power to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone
who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this
power to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch
you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your
appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
psychic save DC.

##### Mass Suggestion

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : 24 hours
You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and influence up to
twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and
understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The
suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound
reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself,
or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the power.

Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course
of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can
continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter
time, the power ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For
example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first
beggar they meet. If the condition isn’t met before the power ends, the activity isn’t
performed.

If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this power, the power
ends for that creature.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 7th-level, the duration is 10 days. When
you cast this power at 8th-level, the duration is 30 days. When you cast this power at


9th-level, the duration is a year and a day.

##### Message

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : 1 round
You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target
(and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can
hear.

You can cast this power through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and
know it is beyond the barrier. Enhanced silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common
metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the power. The power doesn’t have
to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

##### Mind Blank

_8th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 24 hours
Until the power ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage, any
effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, powers used to determine
location, scrying sensors, and the charmed condition. This power even foils the _weave
reality_ power and powers or effects of similar power used to affect the target’s mind or
to gain information about the target.

##### Mind Sliver

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : 1 round
You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of one creature you can
see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d6
psychic damage and subtract 1d4 from the next saving throw it makes before the end of
your next turn.

**_At Higher Levels._** This power’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels:


5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

##### Mind Spike

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
You reach into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must
make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 3d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, you also always know the target's
location until the power ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of
existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can’t become hidden from you,
and if it’s invisible, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 3rd level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d8 for each level above 2nd.

##### Mind War

_9th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 90 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You unleash the power of your mind to blast the intellect of up to ten creatures of your
choice that you can see within range. Creatures that have an Intelligence score of 2 or
lower are unaffected.

Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes
14d6 psychic damage and is stunned. On a successful save, a target takes half as much
damage and isn’t stunned. If a target is killed by this damage, its head explodes,
assuming it has one.

A stunned target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
On a successful save, the stunning effect ends.

##### Mind Whip

_2nd-level power_


**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 90 feet
**Duration** : 1 round
You psychically lash out at one creature you can see within range. The target must make
an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 psychic damage, and
it can’t take a reaction until the end of its next turn. Moreover, on its next turn, it must
choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the
three. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and suffers none of
the power’s other effects.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 3rd level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. The creatures must be within 30 feet
of each other when you target them.

##### Modify Memory

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to reshape another creature’s memories. One creature that you can see
must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on
the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration.
The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still
hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another power, this power ends, and
none of the target’s memories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an event that it
experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can
permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with
perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or
create a memory of some other event.

You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be
able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills
in any gaps in the details of your description. If the power ends before you have finished
describing the modified memories, the creature’s memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the
modified memories take hold when the power ends.

A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if
the memory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An


illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature
enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might
deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.

A _remove curse_ or _greater restoration_ power cast on the target restores the creature’s
true memory.

**_At Higher Levels._** If you cast this power at 6th level or higher, you can alter the target’s
memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th
level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature’s past (9th level).

#### N Powers

##### Nondetection

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 8 hours
For the duration, you hide a target that you touch from powers that can detect its
location. The target can be a willing creature or a place or an object no larger than 10
feet in any dimension. The target can’t be targeted by any powers or effects that detect
their presence or perceived through scrying sensors.

##### Null Field

_8th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self (10-foot-radius sphere)
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
A 10-foot-radius shimmering sphere of power suppression surrounds you. Within the
sphere, powers can’t be cast and enhanced items become mundane. Until the power
ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.

Powers and other enhanced effects are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude
into it. Tech points or psyker points expended to cast a suppressed power is consumed.
While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed
counts against its duration.

**_Targeted Effects._** Powers and other enhanced effects that target a creature or an object
in the sphere have no effect on that target.


**_Enhanced Areas._** The area of another power or enhanced effect, such as _explosion_ , can’t
extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an enhanced area, the part of the area
that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.

**_Powers._** Any active power or other enhanced effect on a creature or an object in the
sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

**_Enhanced Items._** The properties and powers of enhanced items are suppressed in the
sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as an nonenhanced
longsword.

An enhanced weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a
target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If an enhanced weapon or a
piece of enhanced ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire an
enhanced shot or throw an enhanced javelin at a target outside the sphere), the
enhancement of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

**_Enhanced Travel._** Teleportation fails to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the
destination or the departure point for such enhanced travel. A portal to another
location temporarily closes while in the sphere.

**_Creatures and Objects._** A creature or object summoned or created by powers
temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears
once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.

**_Fracture Warp/Disrupt Warp._** Powers and enhanced effects such as _disrupt warp_ have
no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different _null field_ or
_scrambling field_ powers don’t nullify each other.

#### P Powers

##### Pestilent Touch

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
Make a melee psychic attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, the target takes
3d10 necrotic damage.


**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d10 for each level above 1st.

##### Plague Dart

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : 1 round
You shoot a dart of greenish-black energy at a creature within range. Make a ranged
psychic attack against the creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and
it can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the creature’s form
turns sickly green.

If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the
end of your next turn.

This power’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8),
and 17th level (4d8).

##### Planar Binding

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 hour
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : 24 hours
With this power, you attempt to bind a daemon to your service. The creature must be
within range for the entire casting of the power. (Typically, the creature is first
summoned into the center of an inverted _psychic circle_ in order to keep it trapped while
this power is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma
saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature
was summoned or created by another power, that power’s duration is extended to
match the duration of this power.

A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might
command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to
deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature
is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the
creature carries out your instructions completely before the power ends, it travels to
you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different
plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until
the power ends.


In order to cast this power, you must make an offering worth at least 10,000 g, which
the power will consume.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at a higher level, the duration increases to
10 days when cast at 6th level, to 30 days at 7th level, to 180 days at 8th level, and to a
year and a day at 9th-level.

##### Plane Shift

_7th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a
different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such
as the Blood Fields of Khorne, and you appear in or near that destination. The DM
determines your exact location you transported to.

You can use this power to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a
creature within your reach and make a melee psychic attack against it. On a hit, the
creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is
transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so
transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.

##### Psychic Circle

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 minute
**Range** : 10 feet
**Duration** : 1 hour
You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of psychic energy centered on a point
on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the
cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.

Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: daemons or undead. The circle
affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:

```
⦁ The creature can’t willingly enter the cylinder by nonenhanced means. If the
creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first
succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
⦁ The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.
```

```
⦁ Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the
creature.
```
When you cast this power, you can elect to cause its power to operate in the reverse
direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and
protecting targets outside it.

This power requires at least 1,000 g of holy or unholy water and powdered silver, which
the power consumes.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, the duration
increases by 1 hour for each level above 3rd.

##### Psychic Armor

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 8 hours
You touch a willing creature who isn’t wearing armor, and a protective psychic barrier
surrounds it until the power ends. The target’s base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity
modifier. The power ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the power as an
action.

##### Psychic Crush

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : 1 minute
You overload the mind of one creature you can see within range, filling its psyche with
discordant emotions. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed
save, the target takes 12d6 psionic damage and is stunned for 1 minute. On a successful
save, the target takes half as much damage and isn’t stunned.

The stunned target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
On a successful save, the power ends on the target.

##### Psychic Hand

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet


**Duration** : 1 minute
A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for
the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than
30 feet away from you or if you cast this power again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an
object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open
container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each
time you use it.

The hand can’t attack, activate enhanced items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

##### Psygate

_9th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise
location up to a sector’s distance away, or on a different plane of existence. The portal is
a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the
portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.

The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the
portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly
transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.

Deities, daemon princes, living saints, and other planar rulers can prevent portals
created by this power from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.

When you cast this power, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym,
title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you
are on, the portal opens in the named creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the
creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain
no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the DM deems appropriate. It
might leave, attack you, or help you.

#### R Powers

##### Ray of Contagion


_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward a creature within range. Make a
ranged psychic attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 poison damage
and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is also poisoned until the
end of your next turn.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d8 for each level above 1st.

##### Ray of Frost

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged
psychic attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is
reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

The power’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8),
and 17th level (4d8).

##### Regenerate

_7th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 minute
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 1 hour
You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 +
15 hit points. For the duration of the power, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of
each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).

The target’s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored
after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the power
instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.

##### Reincarnate

_9th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 8 hours


**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature
has been dead no longer than 1 day, the power forms a new adult body for it and then
calls the soul to enter that body. If the target’s soul isn’t free or willing to do so, the
power fails.

The immaterium fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the
creature’s race to change. The DM rolls a d100 and consults the following table to
determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the DM chooses a
form.

If the creature was originally a space marine, a roll resulting in human would instead
return them to their original form.

```
d100 Race
01-09 Beastman
10-34 Human
35-44 Mutant
45-51 Ogryn
52-60 Ratling
61-69 Tainted, Khorne
70-78 Tainted, Nurgle
79-87 Tainted, Slaanesh
88-94 Tainted, Tzeentch
95-98 Tainted, Undivided
99-00 Blank
```
The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences. It retains the
capabilities it had in its original form, except it exchanges its original race for the new
one and changes its racial traits accordingly.

This power requires at least 250,000 g of offerings and incense, which are consumed by
the power.

##### Relocation

_4th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 500 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous


You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You
arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or
one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as “200 feet straight
downward” or “upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet.”

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed what you can carry.
You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to
its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this
power.

If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any
creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the power fails to teleport
you.

##### Remove Curse

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed
item or dangerous technology, its effects remain, but the power breaks its owner’s
attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.

##### Ritual of Champions

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 10 minutes
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You perform a vibrant ritual, imbuing yourself and allies with power. Up to twelve
creatures can partake in the ritual. This ritual can include humanoid sacrifices, wealth,
prayer, or other practices to relish in this power. During this ritual, you must sacrifice at
least 10,000 g worth of wealth (which is consumed by the power). For every humanoid
sacrifice you have, it reduces the cost of the wealth required to perform this ritual by
1,000 g, until it has waived the cost entirely.

A creature that partakes in the ritual gains several benefits. The creature is cured of all
diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison and being frightened, and makes all
Wisdom saving throws with advantage. Its hit point maximum also increases by 2d10,
and it gains the same number of hit points. These benefits last for 24 hours.


#### S Powers

##### Sacred Flame

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target
must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target gains
no benefit from cover for this saving throw.

The power’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8),
and 17th level (4d8).

##### Scorching Ray

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at
one target or several.

Make a ranged psychic attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 3rd level or higher, you create one
additional ray for each level above 2nd.

##### Scrying

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 10 minutes
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of
existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by
how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a
target knows you’re casting this power, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants
to be observed.


```
Knowledge Save Modifier
Secondhand (you have heard of the target) +5
Firsthand (you have met the target) +0
Familiar (you know the target well) -5
Connection Save Modifier
Likeness or picture -2
Possession or garment -4
Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like -10
```
On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this power against it
again for 24 hours.

On a failed save, the power creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You
can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the
target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible
objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.

Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the
target of this power. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn’t
move.

##### Seal Wounds

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your psycasting
ability modifier. This power has no effect on undead or constructs.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, the healing increases
by 1d8 for each level above 1st.

##### Sending

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Unlimited
**Duration** : 1 round
You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are
familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it
knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The power enables creatures


with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence,
but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the
message doesn’t arrive.

##### Sense Emotion

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You attune your senses to pick up the emotions of others for the duration. When you
cast the power, and as your action on each turn until the power ends, you can focus
your senses on one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. You instantly learn the
target’s prevailing emotion, whether it’s love, anger, pain, fear, calm, or something else.
If the target isn’t actually humanoid or it is immune to being charmed, you sense that it
is calm.

##### Sequester

_7th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Until dispelled
By means of this power, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from
detection for the duration. When you cast the power and touch the target, it becomes
invisible and can’t be targeted by powers that would detect its location or perceived
through scrying sensors created by powers.

If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to
flow for it, and it doesn’t grow older.

You can set a condition for the power to end early. The condition can be anything you
choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include
“after 1,000 years” or “when the primarch awakens.” This power also ends if the target
takes any damage.

In order to cast this power, you must expend 50,000 g worth of incense or other
offerings, which the power consumes.

##### Shadow of Magnus


_4th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
Flame-like shadows wreathe your body until the power ends, causing you to become
heavily obscured to others. The shadows turn dim light within 10 feet of you into
darkness, and bright light in the same area to dim light.

Until the power ends, you have resistance to radiant damage. In addition, whenever a
creature within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack, the shadows lash out at that
creature, dealing it 2d8 necrotic damage.

##### Smite

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You shoot electricity from your hands at a creature or object within range. Make a
ranged psychic attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 lightning
damage. A flammable object hit by this power ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.

This power’s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level
(3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

##### Soul Cage

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 reaction, which you take when a humanoid you can see within 60 feet
of you dies
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : 8 hours
This power snatches the soul of a humanoid as it dies and traps it inside of a cage made
from psychic energy. A stolen soul remains inside the cage until the power ends or until
you destroy the cage, which ends the power. While you have a soul inside the cage, you
can exploit it in any of the ways described below. You can use a trapped soul up to six
times. Once you exploit a soul for the sixth time, it is released, and the power ends.
While a soul is trapped, the dead humanoid it came from can’t be revived.

**_Steal Life._** You can use a bonus action to drain vigor from the soul and regain 2d8 hit
points.


**_Query Soul._** You ask the soul a question (no action required) and receive a brief
telepathic answer, which you can understand regardless of the language used. The soul
knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its
ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.

**_Borrow Experience._** You can use a bonus action to bolster yourself with the soul’s life
experience, making your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage.
If you don’t use this benefit before the start of your next turn, it is lost.

**_Eyes of the Dead._** You can use an action to name a place the humanoid saw in life,
which creates an invisible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane of
existence you’re currently on. The sensor remains for as long as you concentrate, up to
10 minutes (as if you were concentrating on a power). You receive visual and auditory
information from the sensor as if you were in its space using your senses.

A creature that can see the sensor (such as one using see invisibility or truesight) sees a
translucent image of the tormented humanoid whose soul you caged.

##### Spare the Dying

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You touch a living creature that has 0 hit points. The creature becomes stable. This
power has no effect on undead or constructs.

##### Speak with Dead

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 10 feet
**Duration** : 10 minutes
You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice within range,
allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and
can’t be undead. The power fails if the corpse was the target of this power within the
last 10 days.

Until the power ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows


only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief,
cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if
you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This power doesn’t return the
creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new
information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t
speculate about future events.

##### Spirit Guardians

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self (15-foot radius)
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the
duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or spectral (your
choice). If you are evil, they appear daemonic.

When you cast this power, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be
unaffected by it. An affected creature’s speed is halved in the area, and when the
creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make
a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage or 3d8
necrotic damage (your choice). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much
damage.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d8 for each level above 3rd.

##### Stitch Flesh

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 bonus action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You psychically stitch together the flesh of a creature. A creature of your choice that you
can see within range regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your psycasting ability modifier.
This power has no effect on undead or constructs.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, the healing increases
by 1d4 for each level above 1st.

##### Suggestion

_2nd-level power_


**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 8 hours
You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and influence a creature
you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be
charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as
to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw
itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the
power.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of
action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can
continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter
time, the power ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For
example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she
meets. If the condition isn’t met before the power expires, the activity isn’t performed.

If you or any of your companions damage the target, the power ends.

##### Summon Daemon

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 90 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
You call forth a daemonic spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see
within range. This corporeal form uses the Daemonic Spirit stat block. When you cast
the power, choose Khorne, Nurgle, Slaanesh, orTzeentch. The creature resembles a
daemon of the chosen type, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The
creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the power ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your
initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal
commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action
and uses its move to avoid danger.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 7th level or higher, use the higher level
wherever the power’s level appears in the stat block.

```
##### Summon Familiar


_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 hour
**Range** : 10 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat,
crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven,
sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the
familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a daemon instead of a beast.

Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat,
it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take
other actions as normal.

When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It
reappears after you cast this power again

While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it
telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar’s eyes and
hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special
senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your
own senses.

As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket
dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As
an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any
unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

You can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this power while you already
have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from
the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.

Finally, when you cast a power with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the
power as if it had cast the power. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it
must use its reaction to deliver the power when you cast it. If the power requires an
attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

##### Symbol

_7th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 minute
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Until dispelled or triggered


When you cast this power, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a
section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the
glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph
can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an
object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet
from where you cast this power, the glyph is broken, and the power ends without being
triggered.

The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
psychic save DC to find it.

You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the power. For glyphs inscribed on a
surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing
another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating
the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers
are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading
the glyph.

You can further refine the trigger so the power is activated only under certain
circumstances or according to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height or
weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or
shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as
those who say a certain password.

When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once
triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes,
after which time the power ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates
is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a
turn or ends its turn there.

**_Death._** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.
**_Discord._** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a
target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is
incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability
checks.
**_Fear._** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1
minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and
must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.
**_Hopelessness._** Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the
target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can’t attack or


target any creature with harmful abilities, powers, or other enhanced effects.
**_Insanity._** Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the
target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can’t take actions, can’t
understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM
controls its movement, which is erratic.
**_Pain._** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated
with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.
**_Sleep._** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10
minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an
action to shake or slap it awake.
**_Stunning._** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for
1 minute on a failed save.

Casting this power requires you to expend 10,000 g of incense and blood-infused
crystals, which the power will consume.

#### T Powers

##### Taldeer’s Glint

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in colorful lights of your choice.

Any creature in the area when the power is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a
Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light
in a 10-foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can
see it, and the affected creature or object can’t benefit from being invisible.

##### Telekinesis

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you
cast the power, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will


on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect
below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any
time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the power.

**_Creature._** You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with
your psycasting ability contested by the creature’s Strength check. If you win the
contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not
beyond the range of this power. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is
restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.

On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic
grip on the creature by repeating the contest.

**_Object._** You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn’t
being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not
beyond the range of this power.

If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your
psycasting ability contested by that creature’s Strength check. If you succeed, you pull
the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but
not beyond the range of this power.

You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a
simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open
container, or pouring the contents from a vial.

##### Telepathy

_8th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Unlimited
**Duration** : 24 hours
You create a telepathic link between yourself and a willing creature with which you are
familiar. The creature can be anywhere on the same plane of existence as you. The
power ends if you or the target are no longer on the same plane.

Until the power ends, you and the target can instantaneously share words, images,
sounds, and other sensory messages with one another through the link, and the target
recognizes you as the creature it is communicating with. The power enables a creature
with an Intelligence score of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your words and
take in the scope of any sensory messages you send to it.


##### Teleport

##### Temporal Weave

_8th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see
within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is
stunned. Otherwise, the power has no effect.

The stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its
turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.

##### True Seeing

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 1 hour
This power gives the willing creature you touch the ability to see things as they actually
are. For the duration, the creature has truesight, notices secret doors hidden by
illusions, and can see into the immaterium, all out to a range of 120 feet.

#### V Powers

##### Vampiric Touch

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your
wounds. Make a melee psychic attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the
target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of
necrotic damage dealt. Until the power ends, you can make the attack again on each of
your turns as an action.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, the damage increases


by 1d6 for each level above 3rd.

#### W Powers

##### Wall of Force

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The
wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an
angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a
hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat
surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with
another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall
cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of
the wall (your choice which side).

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can’t be
dispelled by dispel powers, such as _disrupt warp_. A _disintegrate_ power destroys the wall
instantly, however. The wall also extends into the immaterium, blocking psychic travel
through the wall.

##### Warp Jump

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 bonus action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You open a small hole in the warp to jump through. You teleport up to 30 feet to an
unoccupied space that you can see.

##### Warp Storm

_9th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Sight
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
Red clouds form crackling with lightning and screams of the damned can be heard from
it. Choose a point that you can see, and you create a warp storm 1 mile in diameter,
centered on that point. For each round this storm is active, a new effect occurs, and


each effect that has already occurred repeats again at the beginning of the next round.

**_Round 1._** When the storm first appears, a thunderous boom shakes the very ground
underneath. Each creature beneath the storm takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes
deafened for 5 minutes.

**_Round 2._** An electromagnetic pulse is sent out, scrambling nonenhanced communication
frequencies, and causing electronic communication with nonenhanced devices to be
impossible. All technology and anyone wielding an electronic device takes 2d6 lightning
damage.

**_Round 3._** You call six bolts of lightning from the storm to strike six creatures or objects
of your choice beneath the cloud. A given creature or object can’t be struck by more
than one bolt. A struck creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes
10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_Round 4._** Acidic rain and hailstones fall from the storm. Each creature and object under
the cloud takes 2d6 acid damage and 2d6 kinetic damage.

**_Round 5–10._** Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. The area becomes
difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there takes 1d6 cold damage.
Nonenhanced ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible, and all other ranged
weapons attacks are made at disadvantage. Creatures piloting airborne vehicles must
make a Piloting check against your psychic save DC, losing control of the vehicle on a
failure and causing it to stop flying. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for
the purposes of maintaining concentration on powers. Finally, gusts of strong wind
(ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar
phenomena in the area, whether mundane or enhanced.

##### Waychanger’s Beam

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder
centered on a point within range. Until the power ends, dim light fills the cylinder.

When a creature enters the power’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn
there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a
Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.


A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly
reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different form until it leaves the power’s
light.

On your turns after you cast this power, you can use an action to move the beam up to
60 feet in any direction.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this at 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by
1d10 for each level above 2nd.

##### Weave Reality

9th-level power
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Instantaneous
_Weave reality_ is the mightiest power a mortal creature can cast. By reweaving the
threads of fate, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.

The basic use of this power is to duplicate any other power of 8th level or lower. You
don’t need to meet any requirements in that power, including costly components that
are consumed by a power. The power simply takes effect.

Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:

```
⦁ You create one object of up to 250,000 g in value that isn’t an enhanced item.
The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an
unoccupied space you can see on the ground.
⦁ You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and
you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration power.
⦁ You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you
choose.
⦁ You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single power or other
enhanced effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your
companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.
⦁ You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last
round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new
result. For example, a weave reality power could undo an opponent’s successful
save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be
made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the
```

```
reroll or the original roll.
```
You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State
your desire to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what
occurs in such an instance; the greater the desire, the greater the likelihood that
something goes wrong. This power might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be
partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how
you worded the desire. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you
forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you
from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary enhanced item or artifact might
instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner.

The stress of casting this power to produce any effect other than duplicating another
power weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a power until you
finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that power. This damage
can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t
3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and
doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2
days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast _weave reality_ ever
again if you suffer this stress.

##### Witch Bolt

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a
sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged psychic attack
against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage, and on each of
your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12 lightning damage to
the target automatically. The power ends if you use your action to do anything else. The
power also ends if the target is ever outside the power’s range or if it has total cover
from you.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, the initial damage
increases by 1d12 for each level above 1st.

##### Word of Eschaton

_7th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 bonus action


**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You utter a word, imbued with the power that wrests control of the powers that be.
Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. Each creature that can hear
you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect
based on its current hit points:

```
⦁ 50 hit points or fewer: deafened for 1 minute
⦁ 40 hit points or fewer: deafened and blinded for 10 minutes
⦁ 30 hit points or fewer: blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 hour
⦁ 20 hit points or fewer: killed instantly
```
Regardless of its current hit points, a daemon that fails its save is forced back into the
immaterium (if it isn’t there already) and can’t return to realspace for 24 hours by any
means short of a _weave reality_ power.

#### Z Powers

##### Zone of Truth

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : 10 minutes
You create a psychic zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere
centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the power ends, a creature that
enters the power’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a
Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in
the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.

An affected creature is aware of the power and can thus avoid answering questions to
which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers
as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.

## Tech Power

#### A Powers

##### Advanced Hacking

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
You gain advantage on all Intelligence checks using tools or ability checks to break
software encryption or online security.

This power also allows you to break 2nd level and lower protective powers such as _lock_
by making a Tech check against the tech save DC of the power’s caster.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 3rd level or higher, you can attempt to
counteract a power set to secure the system if the power’s level is equal to or less than
the level of the power you used.

##### Aid

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : 8 hours
You administer aid to your allies. Choose up to three creatures within range. Each
target’s hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 5 for the duration.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 3rd level or higher, a target’s hit points
increase by an additional 5 for each level above 2nd.

##### Air Blast

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self (60-foot line)
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
A line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you


choose for the power’s duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must
succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction
following the line.

Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when
moving closer to you.

The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar
unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to
dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.

As a bonus action on each of your turns before the power ends, you can change the
direction in which the line blasts from you.

##### Alarm

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : 8 hours
You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area
within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the power ends, an alarm alerts
you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you
cast the power, you can designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You also
choose whether the alarm is audible, or if the alarm only enters in through a
communication device, such as a headcomm.

A silent alarm alerts you with a ping over a communication device you have if you are
within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

An audible alarm produces the sound of a siren for 10 seconds within 60 feet.

##### Analyze

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 minute
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the power. If it is
an enhanced or modified item, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it
requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any
powers are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a power,


you learn which power created it.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what tech powers, if
any, are currently affecting it.

##### Arcing Ray

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You create three rays of electricity and target them at creatures within range. You can
hurl them at one target or several. Make a ranged tech attack for each ray. On a hit, the
target takes 2d6 lightning damage.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 3rd level or higher, you create one
additional ray for each level above 2nd.

#### B Powers

##### Blur

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you. For the
duration, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is
immune to this effect if it doesn't rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through
illusions, as with truesight.

##### Boost Resistance

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You touch one willing creature. Once before the power ends, the target can roll a d4 and
add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before or
after the saving throw. The power then ends.


##### Boost Skill

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You touch one willing creature. Once before the power ends, the target can roll a d4 and
add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after
making the ability check. The power then ends.

#### C Powers

##### Chain Lightning

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 150 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of your choice that you can see
within range. Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three other targets,
each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or an
object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts.

A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d8 lightning damage on
a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 7th level or higher, one additional bolt
leaps from the first target to another target for each level above 6th.

##### Chronometron

_9th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other
creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and
move as normal.

This power ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you
create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or


carried by someone other than you. In addition, the power ends if you move to a place
more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.

##### Cloaking Field

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
A creature you touch becomes invisible until the power ends. Anything the target is
wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target’s person. The power ends for
a target that attacks or casts a power.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power using at 3rd level or higher, you can target
one additional creature for each level above 2nd.

##### Clone

_8th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 hour
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
This power grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard against death.
This clone forms inside a sealed cloning vat and grows to full size and maturity after 120
days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger version of the same creature.
It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vat remains undisturbed.

At any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its soul transfers to the
clone, provided that the soul is free and willing to return. The clone is physically
identical to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none
of the original’s equipment. The original creature’s physical remains, if they still exist,
become inert and can’t thereafter be restored to life, since the creature’s soul is
elsewhere.

This power requires at least 1 inch of cubic flesh of the creature that is to be cloned,
which the power consumes. The vat to grow the clone costs at least 20,000 g and must
be large enough to hold a creature the same size as the cloned creature.

##### Combat Analysis

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet


**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You analyze up to three creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a target makes
an attack roll or a saving throw before the power ends, the target can roll a d4 and add
the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each level above 1st.

##### Copy

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
This power creates a perfect duplicate of any written, drawn, or digital visual, audio or
text-based data that you touch onto a datapad or datacard you supply. You can copy up
to 10 pages of text or 10 minutes of visual or audio data with one casting of this power.
Enhanced documents, such as ancient cogitators, Standard Template Constructs (STCs),
or encrypted documents, can’t be copied with this power.

##### Countermeasures

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : 10 minutes
For the duration, you gain the following benefits:

```
⦁ You and objects you are wearing or carrying cannot be detected by tech powers
that reveal your location, such as locate creature , unless the caster makes a
successful Intelligence saving throw.
⦁ Creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track you.
```
##### Cryo Spray

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You spray a line of cryogenic material toward a creature within range.. Make a ranged
tech attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is
reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.


**_At Higher Levels._** The power’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8),
11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

##### Cybernetic Resurrection

_9th-level exertion_
**Casting Time** : 8 hours
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You begin a gruelling surgery on a creature that has been dead for no longer than 10
days and that died for any reason. If the creature’s soul is free and willing, the creature
is restored to life with all its hit points. When the cybernetic resurrection is complete, if
the creature is a humanoid or undead, they are turned into a techfused humanoid. If the
creature is not a humanoid, its creature type is changed to construct.

This power closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, and cures all diseases that afflicted
the target during life. This power replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs with
cybernetic limbs.

This power requires at least 250,000 g of cybernetic components, which are consumed
by the power, to replace any damaged tissue and organs.

#### D Powers

##### Darkness

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Enhanced darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius
sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with
darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonenhanced light can’t illuminate it.

If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or
carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering
the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the
darkness.

If any of this power’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a power of 2nd level
or lower, the power that created the light is dispelled.


##### Darkvision

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 8 hours
You touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see in the dark. For the duration,
that creature has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

##### Debilitating Gas

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 90 feet
**Duration** : Up to 1 minute
You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of gas centered on a point. The cloud spreads around
corners and its area is heavily obscured. It lingers in the air for the duration.

Each creature completely in the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution
save against poison. On a failure, the creature does nothing that turn. Creatures that
don’t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed.

A wind of 10mph disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A wind of 20mph disperses it after
1 round.

##### Defibrillate

_4th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You touch a creature that has died within the last minute and administer a shock to
restore it to life. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This power can’t return to
life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts. If the
creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—
the power automatically fails. Once this power has restored a creature to life, that
creature can’t benefit from this power again until it finishes a short or long rest.

##### Delayed Explosion

_7th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action


**Range** : 150 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a delayed explosion at a point within range. When the power ends, either
because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the explosion
occurs. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a
Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The power’s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the explosion has not yet
occurred, the damage increases by 1d6.

If the explosion is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must
make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the power ends immediately, causing
the explosion.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t
being worn or carried.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power using at 8th level or higher, the base
damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 7th.

##### Detect Enhancement

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
For the duration, you sense the presence of any enhancements within 30 feet of you. If
you sense an enhancement in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura
around any visible creature or object in the area that bears an enhancement.

The power is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead,
or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

##### Detect Invisibility

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : 1 hour
For the duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible.


##### Detect Toxins

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
For the duration, you can sense the presence and location of poisons, poisonous
creatures, and diseases within 30 feet of you. You also identify the kind of poison,
poisonous creature, or disease in each case.

This power can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of
common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

##### Diminish Tech

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
Choose one creature, object, or enhanced effect within range. Any tech power of 3rd
level or lower on the target ends. For each tech power of 4th level or higher on the
target, make an ability check using your techcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the
power’s level. On a success, the power ends.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, you automatically end
the effects of a tech power on the target if the power’s level is equal to or less than the
level of the power level you used.

##### Disable Device

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You emit an electromagnetic pulse, targeting one nonenhanced electronic device within
range, causing the device to shut down for the duration. If the device is being held or
operated by a creature, the creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw to
stop the device from being shut down.

A creature can attempt to restart a device by using an action to make an Intelligence
check against your tech save DC, ending the effect on a success.


If you target a worn suit of power armor with this power, the creature must make an
Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the creature has disadvantage on all attack rolls
until this effect ends. The creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on a success.

**_At Higher Levels._** If you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, you can target an
additional device within range for each level over 1st.

##### Displacer Jump

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 bonus action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.

##### Distort Value

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 minute
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 8 hours
You cast this power on an object no more than 1 foot on a side, doubling the object's
perceived value by adding decorative flourish or reducing its perceived value by half
with the help of superficial dents and scratches. Anyone examining the object must roll
an Investigation check against your tech save DC.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power using a higher level, you increase the size of
the object by 1 foot per level over 1st.

#### E Powers

##### Electric Jolt

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 reaction, which you take when you are damaged by a creature within 60
feet of you that you can see
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
The creature that damaged you is surrounded by electric crackling. The creature must
make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 2d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half
as much damage on a successful one.


**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d10 for level above 1st.

##### Electrical Burst

_At-will power_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range** : 5 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You send a burst of electricity strikes at enemies around you. Each creature of your
choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take
1d6 lightning damage.

The power’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6),
and 17th level (4d6).

##### Electrocution

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 90 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
Electricity pulses around a creature you can see within range. The target must make a
Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target is also electrocuted for the
power’s duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It
takes 3d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and the power ends on a successful one.

##### Encrypted Message

_At-will power_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : 1 round

You point your finger toward a creature within range that possesses a communication
device, such as a commlink or headcomm, and whisper a message. The target (and only
the target) hears the message and can send an encrypted reply that only you can hear.
These messages cannot be intercepted or decrypted by nonenhanced means.

You can cast this power through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and


know it is beyond the barrier. 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of
lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the power. The power doesn’t have to follow a straight
line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

##### Enhance Weapon

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
A nonenhanced weapon you touch becomes an enhanced weapon. Choose one of these
damage types: acid, cold, energy, fire, kinetic, or lightning. For the duration, an
nonenhanced weapon you touch has a +1 to attack rolls and deals an extra 1d4 damage
of the chosen type.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 5th or 6th level, the bonus to attack rolls
increases to +2 and the extra damage increases to 2d4. When you cast this power at 7th
level or higher, the bonus increases to +3 and the extra damage increases to 3d4.

##### Ensnaring Strike

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 bonus action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this power ends, you
attempt to ensnare them, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be
restrained until the power ends. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving
throw.

While restrained by this power, the target takes 1d6 kinetic damage at the start of each
of its turns. A creature restrained by this power or one that can touch the creature can
use its action to make a Strength check against your tech save DC. On a success, the
target is freed.

**_At Higher Levels._** If you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by
1d6 for each level above 1st.

##### Entangle

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action


**Range** : 90 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You throw entangling nets, covering a 20-foot square starting from a point within range.
For the duration, these nets turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

A creature in the area when you cast the power must succeed on a Strength saving
throw or be restrained by the nets until the power ends. A creature restrained by the
nets can use its action to make a Strength check against your tech save DC. On a
success, it frees itself.

When the power ends, the nets break and become unusable.

##### Etherium

_7th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Up to 8 hours
You step into the border regions of the immaterium, in the area where it overlaps with
realspace. You remain between the immaterium and realspace for the duration, or until
you use your action to dismiss the power. During this time, you can move in any
direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can
see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and you
can’t see anything more than 60 feet away.

While within the immaterium, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures of
that plane. Creatures that aren’t in the immaterium can’t perceive you and can’t
interact with you, unless a special ability or power has given them the ability to do so.

You ignore all objects that aren’t within the immaterium, allowing you to move through
objects you perceive in realspace. When the power ends, you immediately return to
realspace in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object
or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied
space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you
are moved.

This power has no effect if you cast it while you are already in the immaterium or in an
area that prevents planar travel.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 8th level or higher, you can target up to
three willing creatures (including you) for each level above 7th. The creatures must be
within 10 feet of you when you cast the power.


##### Expeditious Retreat

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 bonus action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
This power allows you to move at an incredible pace. When you cast this power, and
then as a bonus action on each of your turns until the power ends, you can take the
Dash action.

##### Exploit Weakness

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make
Intelligence saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an
attack roll or a saving throw before the power ends, the target must roll a d4 and
subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each level above 1st.

##### Explosion

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 150 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You cause an explosion at a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 20-foot
radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners. It
ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d6 for each level above 3rd.

##### Explosive Shot

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 bonus action


**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
The next time you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack before the power ends,
this power creates a small explosion from your ranged weapon or ammunition. In
addition to the normal effect of the attack, the target of the attack and each creature
within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d10 fire
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_At Higher Levels._** If you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by
1d10 for each level above 1st (to a maximum of 6d10).

#### F Powers

##### Find the Path

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 minute
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 day
This power calculates out the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed
location that you are familiar with, within a sub-sector’s distance away. If you name a
destination that on another plane of existence, moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a
destination that isn’t specific (such as “a Chaos Champion’s lair”), the power fails.

For the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination,
you know how far it is and in what direction it lies. While you are traveling there,
whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically
determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the
safest route) to the destination.

##### Fire Storm

_7th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 150 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You create sheets of roaring flame to appear in a location you choose within range. The
area of the flames consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you
wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each
creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d10 fire damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being
worn or carried.

##### First Aid

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You administer first aid to a creature. A creature you can touch regains a number of hit
points equal to 1d8 + your techcasting ability modifier. This power has no effect on
undead or constructs.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, the healing increases
by 1d8 for each level above 1st.

##### Flash Freeze

_4th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 300 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You cryofreeze an area in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point
within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A
creature takes 2d8 kinetic damage and 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.

Frozen ice turns the area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 5th level or higher, the kinetic damage
increases by 1d8 for each level above 4th.

##### Forbiddance

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 10 minutes
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 1 day
You create a field, similar to a geller field, against planar travel that protects up to
40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration,
creatures can’t teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the _gate_
power, to enter the area. The power proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore


prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the immaterium or the _plane shift_
power.

In addition, the power damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it.
Choose one or more of the following: daemons and undead. When a chosen creature
enters the power’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature
takes 5d10 psionic damage.

When you cast this power, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the
password as it enters the area takes no damage from the power.

This power’s area can’t overlap with the area of another _forbiddance_ power. If you cast
_forbiddance_ every day for 30 days in the same location, the power lasts until it is
dispelled, but casting it in this way requires at least 10,000 g of materials and
technology to maintain the power.

#### G Powers

##### Gauss Blast

_8th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 150 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You send a green blast of energy in a 30-foot cube centered on a point you choose
within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A
creature takes 10d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

##### Gauss Lance

_4th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You send a green lance of energy at a target that you can see within range. The target
must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 5th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d8 for each level above 4th.


##### Gleaming Outline

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in bright light.

Any creature in the area when the power is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a
Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light
in a 10-foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can
see it, and the affected creature or object can’t benefit from being invisible.

##### Graviton Fissure

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You activate a ravine of gravitational energy in a line originating from you that is 100
feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a Constitution saving
throw, taking 8d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

Each creature within 10 feet of the line but not in it must succeed on a Constitution
saving throw or take 8d8 force damage and be pulled toward the line until the creature
is in its area.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 7th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d8 for each level above 6th.

##### Graviton Sinkhole

_4th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
A 20-foot-radius sphere of crushing force forms at a point you can see within range and
tugs at the creatures there. Each creature in the sphere must make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d10 force damage and is pulled in a straight


line toward the center of the sphere, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the
center as possible (even if that space is in the air). On a successful save, the creature
takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 5th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d10 for each level above 4th.

##### Greater Cloaking Field

_4th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the power ends. Anything the target
is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target’s person.

##### Greater Translation Program

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 1 hour
This power grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken language
it hears, as long as the language is not a lost or unknown language. Moreover, when the
target speaks, any creature that knows at least one language and can hear the target
understands what it says, provided the language they know is also not a lost or unknown
language.

#### H Powers

##### Haste

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the power ends, the
target’s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving
throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used
only to take the Attack action (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use
an Object action.


When the power ends, the target can’t move or take actions until after its next turn, as
a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.

##### Healing Drone

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 bonus action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You send out a drone to administer a dose of stimulants before it falls over, inert. A
creature of your choice that you can see within range regains hit points equal to 1d4 +
your techcasting ability modifier. This power has no effect on undead or constructs.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, the healing increases
by 1d4 for each level above 1st.

##### Heat Metal

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of heavy or
medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-
hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage when you
cast the power. Until the power ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your
subsequent turns to cause this damage again.

If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature
must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn’t
drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of
your next turn.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 3rd level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d8 for each level above 2nd.

##### Holographic Disguise

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : 1 hour
Until the power ends or you use an action to dismiss it, you can disguise yourself


through the use of a hologram emitter. You can appear to be shorter or taller by about a
foot and change the appearance of your body weight, but you cannot change the basic
structure of your body. The hologram can include your clothes, armor, weapons, and
other belongings on your person.

The illusion is only visual, so any sort of physical contact will only interact with the real
size and shape of you. A creature can use its action to make an Intelligence
(Investigation) check against your tech save DC, seeing through the hologram on a
success.

#### I Powers

##### Implant Message

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 minute
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : Until dispelled
You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a
trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being worn or
carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less,
though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the
circumstance that will trigger the power to deliver your message.

When that circumstance occurs, the message is recited in your voice and at the same
volume you spoke. When you cast this power, you can have the power end after it
delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger
occurs.

The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must
be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For
example, you could instruct the message to play when any creature moves within 30
feet of the object or when a bell rings within 30 feet of it.

##### Incendiary Cloud

_8th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 150 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a 20-foot-


radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners and is
heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed
(at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A
creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the power’s
area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the
start of each of your turns.

##### Induce Coma

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 minute
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Until dispelled
This power can induce a coma into a target. When you cast this power and touch a
target, you insert coma-inducing drugs. While in a coma, the target falls into a state of
suspended animation. It doesn’t suffer from the effects of hunger or dehydration, and it
stops aging. Any poisons and diseases the target is suffering from are suspended during
this time. The target can survive for up to 30 days in this state, and can live indefinitely if
placed in a vat with medical equipment worth at least 30,000 g.

This effect can be dispelled by filtering out the drugs over the course of one hour using a
set of chirurgeon’s tools or similar tools. Alternatively, a power such as _medicae major_
or a greater power can be used to dispel this power.

##### Invisibility to Cameras

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 10 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Up to four creatures of your choice become undetectable to electronic sensors and
cameras. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is also undetectable, so long as it’s
on the target’s person. The target is still visible to regular vision.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, you can target an
additional creature for each level above 3rd.


##### Invulnerability

_9th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You are immune to all damage until the power ends.

#### L Powers

##### Light

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 1 hour
You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the power
ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20
feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with
something opaque blocks the light. The power ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an
action.

If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on
a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the power.

##### Lightning Surge

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self (100-foot line)
**Duration** : Instantaneous
A stroke of lightning forming a line of 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you
in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw.
A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d6 for each level above 3rd.


##### Lock

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Until dispelled
You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked
for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this power can
open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet
of the object, suppresses this power for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is
broken or the power is dispelled or suppressed. Casting release on the object
suppresses lock for 10 minutes.

While affected by this power, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC
to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.

Alternatively, you can touch a device such as a data slate, computer, or recording
device, and cause it to become encrypted. While affected by this power, the device is
more difficult to hack into; the DC to hack into it or retrieve information from it
increases by 10.

##### Long Comm

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Unlimited
**Duration** : 1 round
You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are
familiar that possesses a communication device, such as a commlink. The creature hears
the message, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like
manner immediately.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planets, but if the
target is on a different plane of existence than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the
message doesn’t arrive.

#### M Powers

##### Major Hologram

_3rd-level power_


**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create an image no larger than a 20 foot cube. It appears at a spot you can see and
lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, sounds and other sensory effects
included. You can’t create a sensory effect strong enough to cause damage or a
condition.

As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to make the
image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can
alter it so that its movements appear natural for the image.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it as an illusion. A creature can use its action
to determine that it’s an illusion with a successful Investigation check. If a creature
learns it’s an illusion, it can see through the image, and the other sensory qualities
become faint to it.

**_At Higher Levels._** The power lasts until dispelled without requiring concentration if cast
at 6th-level or higher.

##### Mass First Aid

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous

by 1d8 for each level above 5th.

##### Medicae Major

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action

You touch a creature to undo a debilitating effect. You can reduce the target’s
exhaustion level by one, or end one of the following effects on the target:
⦁ One effect that charmed or petrified the target
⦁ The attunement of an item that is dangerous technology or a cursed item.
⦁ Any reduction to one of the target’s ability scores
⦁ One effect reducing the target’s hit point maximum

##### Memory Bank

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 10 minutes
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Instantaneous
Name or describe a person, place, or object. This power gives you a summary of
significant lore about it. If the thing you named isn’t known outside of one sector’s
distance, you gain no information. The more information you already have, the more
detailed the information you receive is.

##### Mending

_At-will power_


**Casting Time** : 1 minute
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
This ability repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as broken chain
link, two halves of a broken key, a torn strap, or a leaking cup. As long as the break or
tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the
former damage.

##### Mind Blank

_8th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 24 hours
Until the power ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psionic damage, any
effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, and the charmed condition.
The power foils _weave reality_ powers or effects of similar power used to affect the
target’s mind or to gain information about the target.

##### Mind Numb

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You send out a brain-scrambling wave inside a 30-foot cube within range. Each creature
in the area who sees the pattern must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed by this power,
the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.

The power ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses
an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.

##### Mind Stun

_8th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You shoot out an electromagnetic force to stun the mind of one creature you can see
within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is
stunned. Otherwise, the power has no effect. The stunned target must make an
Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this


stunning effect ends.

##### Mind Wipe

_8th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 150 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range, attempting to shatter its
intellect and personality. The target takes 4d6 psionic damage and must make an
Intelligence saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature’s Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1. The
creature can’t cast powers, activate enhanced items, understand language, or
communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can, however, identify its friends,
follow them, and even protect them.

At the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its saving throw against this power.
If it succeeds on its saving throw, the power ends. The power by powerful effects such
as can also be ended by _medicae major_ or _weave reality_.

##### Minor Medicae

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You touch a creature and can end either one nonenhanced disease or one condition
afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.

##### Minor Hologram

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 10 feet
**Duration** : Up to 1 hour
This ability is a minor tech trick that creates one of the following effects within range.

```
⦁ You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of
sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
⦁ You instantaneously light or snuff out a source of light.
⦁ You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
```

```
⦁ You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
⦁ You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for
1 hour.
⦁ You create a trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts
until the end of your next turn.
```
If you use this power multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous
effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

##### Mirror Image

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : 1 minute
Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the power ends, the
duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it’s impossible to
track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the power’s duration, roll a d20
to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack’s target to
a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you
must roll an 11 or higher.

A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the
duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It
ignores all other damage and effects. The power ends when all three duplicates are
destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this power if it can’t see, if it relies on senses other than
sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

##### Mislead

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
You become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you


are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or
cast a power.

You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make
it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is.
On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using
your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in
regard to your own surroundings.

#### O Powers

##### Oil Slick

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : 1 minute
You cover the ground in a 10-foot square within range in oil. For the duration, it is
difficult terrain.

When the oil appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity
saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must
also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw.

The oil is flammable. Any 5 foot square of the oil exposed to fire burns away in one
round. Each creature who enters the fire or starts its turn there must make a Dexterity
saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful
one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

##### On/Off

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
This power allows you to activate or deactivate any electronic device within range, as
long as the device is not being wielded by a creature, and has a clearly defined on or off
function that can be easily accessed from the outside of the device. Any device that
requires a software-based shutdown sequence to activate or deactivate cannot be


affected by _on/off_.

##### Overload

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self (15-foot cube)
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You expel a burst of energy. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must
make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder
damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes
half as much damage and isn't pushed.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d8 for each level above 1st.

##### Override Tech

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you
casting a tech power
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a tech power. If the
creature is casting a power of 3rd level or lower, its power fails and has no effect. If it is
casting a power of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your techcasting
ability. The DC equals 10 + the power’s level. On a success, the creature’s power fails
and has no effect.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, the interrupted
power has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the power you used.

#### P Powers

##### Paralyze Construct

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to short-circuit a construct within range, paralyzing it. The target must

You emit a brain-scrambling wave to a creature that you can see within range. The
target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration.
This power has no effect on undead. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make
another Intelligence saving throw. On a success, the power ends on the target.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 6th level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each level above 5th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of
each other when you target them.

##### Paralyze Person

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You emit a brain-scrambling wave to a humanoid that you can see within range. The
target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At
the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Intelligence saving throw. On a
success, the power ends on the target.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 3rd level or higher, you can target one
additional humanoid for each level above 2nd. The humanoids must be within 30 feet of
each other when you target them.

##### Particle Teleporter

_4th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 500 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous


You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You
arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or
one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as "200 feet straight
downward" or "upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet".

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed what you can carry.
You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to
its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this
power.

If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any
creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the power fails to teleport
you.

##### Perfect Medication

_9th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You administer the perfect medication to a creature you touch. The target regains all its
hit points. If the creature is charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned, the condition
ends. If the creature is prone, it can use its reaction to stand up. This power has no
effect on undead or constructs.

##### Photon Beam

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self (60-foot line)
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-line. Each
creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature
takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it
takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded by this power.

You can create a new line of photon energy as your action on any turn until the power
ends.

##### Photon Cannon

_8th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action


**Range** : 150 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
Brilliant light flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range.
Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it
takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded by this power.

A creature blinded by this power makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of
each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.

This power dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a power.

##### Photon Lances

_7th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : 1 hour
Seven lances of pure light appear and orbit your head until the power ends. You can use
a bonus action to send one of the motes streaking toward one creature or object within
120 feet of you. When you do so, make a ranged tech attack. On a hit, the target takes
4d12 radiant damage. Whether you hit or miss, the lance is expended. The power ends
early if you expend the last lance. If you have four or more motes remaining, they shed
bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. If you have one to
three motes remaining, they shed dim light in a 30-foot radius.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 8th level or higher, the number of motes
created increases by two for each level above 7th.

##### Photon Spark

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 90 feet
**Duration** : 1 round
You create a massive flash of light and explosion of sound at a point within range. Roll
6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this power can affect. Creatures
within 20 feet of the point are affected in ascending order of their current hit points
(ignoring unconscious creatures).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected
by this power is blinded until the end of your next turn. Subtract each creature’s hit


points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A
creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature
to be affected.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, roll an additional
2d10 for each level above 1st.

##### Plasma Discharge

_At-will power_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You hurl an orb of plasma at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged tech
attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 acid damage. A flammable
object hit by this power ignites if it isn’t being worn or carried.

This power’s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level
(3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

##### Plasma Shot

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 90 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You shoot a projectile of acid toward a target within range. Make a ranged tech attack
against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid
damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid
for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 3rd level or higher, the damage (both
initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each level above 2nd.

##### Predictive Algorithm

_9th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 minute
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 8 hours
You touch a willing creature, granting them a limited AI companion that can predict the
world around them. For the duration, the target can’t be surprised and has advantage
on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, other creatures have


disadvantage on attack rolls against the target for the duration.

This power immediately ends if you cast it again before its duration ends.

##### Programmed Hologram

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Until dispelled
You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within
range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until
then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the power
how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last
up to 5 minutes.

When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs
in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and
remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.

The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be
based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example,
you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to
open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says
the correct word or phrase.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass
through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is
an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC.
If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image,
and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

##### Project Hologram

_7th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 500 miles
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 24 hours
You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear
at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening
obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any
damage, it disappears, and the power ends.


You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it
gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms
perfectly.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On
your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or
back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to
your own surroundings.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass
through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is
an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC.
If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image,
and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

##### Protection from Energy

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
For the duration, the willing creature you touch has resistance to one damage type of
your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

##### Pyrotechnics

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
Choose an area of nonenhanced flame that you can see and that fits within a 5-foot
cube within range. You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either
fireworks or smoke when you do so.

**_Fireworks._** The target explodes with a dazzling display of colors. Each creature within 10
feet of the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until
the end of your next turn.

**_Smoke._** Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving
around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1
minute or until a strong wind disperses it.


#### R Powers

##### Read Data

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 10 feet
**Duration** : 10 minutes
You read the memory of an object or an incapacitated construct within range. The
target must have its memory core (and/or other appropriate components) intact.

Until the power ends, you can ask up to five questions. Depending on what it would
know or has witnessed, the target provides visual, audio, or text-based data in response.
The target can’t provide new information, and can’t speculate about future events.

##### Release

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a
chest, a set of binders, a lock, or another object that contains a mundane or enhanced
means that prevents access.

A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes
unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is
unlocked.

Alternatively, you can target one nonenhanced electronic device, and immediately
break through one of its firewalls, passwords, or other security system.

If you choose a target that is held shut or reinforced with the _lock_ power, that power is
suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut
normally.

##### Repair

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch


**Duration** : Instantaneous
A construct or object you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your
techcasting ability modifier.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, the healing increases
by 1d8 for each level above 1st.

##### Resuscitate

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You touch a living creature that has 0 Hit Points. The creature becomes stable. This
power has no effect on undead.

##### Reverse Gravity

_7th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 100 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
This power reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high cylinder centered on a
point within range. All creatures and objects that aren’t somehow anchored to the
ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this power.
A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach,
thus avoiding the fall.

If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and
creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or
creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there,
oscillating slightly, for the duration.

At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.

#### S Powers

##### Scan Area

_4th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self


**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You program a creature or object that you are familiar with into a recording device, such
as a data slate. Using a sonar scan, the device attempts to find a path to the creature’s
or object’s location, as long as that creature or object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the
creature or object is moving, you know the direction of its movement.

The power can locate a specific creature or object known to you, or the nearest
creature/object of a specific kind (such as a space marine or an eldar), so long as you
have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once.

##### Scrambling Field

_8th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self (10-foot-radius sphere)
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
A 10-foot-radius shimmering sphere of power suppression surrounds you. Within the
sphere, powers can’t be cast and enhanced items become mundane. Until the power
ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.

Powers and other enhanced effects are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude
into it. Tech points or psyker points expended to cast a suppressed power is consumed.
While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed
counts against its duration.

**_Targeted Effects._** Powers and other enhanced effects that target a creature or an object
in the sphere have no effect on that target.

**_Enhanced Areas._** The area of another power or enhanced effect, such as _explosion_ , can’t
extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an enhanced area, the part of the area
that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.

**_Powers._** Any active power or other enhanced effect on a creature or an object in the
sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

**_Enhanced Items._** The properties and powers of enhanced items are suppressed in the
sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as an nonenhanced
longsword.

An enhanced weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a
target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If an enhanced weapon or a
piece of enhanced ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire an


enhanced shot or throw an enhanced javelin at a target outside the sphere), the
enhancement of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

**_Enhanced Travel._** Teleportation fails to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the
destination or the departure point for such enhanced travel. A portal to another
location temporarily closes while in the sphere.

**_Creatures and Objects._** A creature or object summoned or created by powers
temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears
once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.

**_Override Tech/Diminish Tech._** Powers and enhanced effects such as _diminish tech_ have
no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different _null field_ or
_scrambling field_ powers don’t nullify each other.

##### Seeming

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : 8 hours
This power allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you
can see within range through the use of holograms. You give each target you choose a
new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make an Intelligence saving throw,
and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this power.

The power disguises physical appearances as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and
equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin,
fat, or in-between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form
that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up
to you. The power lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.

The changes wrought by this power fail to hold up to physical inspections. For example,
if you use this power to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat,
and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and
hair. If you use this power to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who
reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation)
check against your tech save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is
disguised.


##### Sensor Probe

_4th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 30 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
You create a small, temporary, invisible probe that hovers in the air for the duration.
You receive visual information from the probe on a recording device, such as a data
slate. It has darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction.

As an action, you can move the probe up to 30 feet in any direction. There’s no limit on
how far away from you it can be. A solid barrier blocks the probe’s movement, but it can
pass through an opening at least 1 inch in diameter.

##### Shared Shielding

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 1 hour
This power wards a willing creature you touch and creates an energy link between you
and the target until the power ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +
1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it
takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.

The power ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by
more than 60 feet. It also ends if the power is cast again on either of the connected
creatures. You can also dismiss the power as an action.

##### Shatter

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within
range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a
Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half
as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as
stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

A nonehanced object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the


power’s area.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 3rd level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d8 for each level above 2nd.

##### Shutdown

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You emit an electromagnetic pulse, shutting down all electronic devices that are not
held by or under the direct control of a creature. If it is, the creature must succeed on an
Intelligence saving throw to stop the device from being shut down. While the power is
active, no electronic device in range can be started or restarted.

##### Shocking Grasp

_At-will power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You deliver a shock to a creature you can touch. Make a melee tech attack against the
target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of
metal, or if the creature is made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning
damage, and it can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

The power’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8),
and 17th level (4d8).

##### Silence

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius
sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely
inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while
entirely inside it.

##### Silent Hologram


_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is
no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the
duration. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other
sensory effects.

You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the
image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear
natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it,
you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass
through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is
an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC.
If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

##### Skill Empowerment

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
Your skills deepens a creature’s understanding of its own talent. You touch one willing
creature and give it expertise in one skill of your choice; until the power ends, the
creature doubles its proficiency bonus for ability checks it makes that use the chosen
skill.

You must choose a skill in which the target is proficient and that isn’t already benefiting
from an effect, such as Expertise, that doubles its proficiency bonus.

##### Slow

_3rd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range.
Each target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be affected by this power
for the duration.


An affected target’s speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving
throws, and it can’t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus
action, not both. Regardless of the creature’s abilities or enhanced items, it can’t make
more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.

If the creature attempts to cast a power with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an
11 or higher, the power doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the
creature must use its action on that turn to complete the power. If it can’t, the power is
wasted.

A creature affected by this power makes another Intelligence saving throw at the end of
its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.

##### Smoke Cloud

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
You cause thick smoke to erupt from a point within range, filling a 20-foot-radius
sphere. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for
the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour)
disperses it.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, the radius of the
smoke cloud increases by 20 feet for each level above 1st.

##### Smuggle

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 hour
You dampen sound and light and dull the scent from creatures in your vicinity. For the
duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you has a +10 bonus to Dexterity
(Stealth) checks and can’t be tracked except by enhanced means while within this
radius. You can choose yourself as well. A creature that receives this bonus leaves
behind no traces of its passage.

##### Stall Gravity

_1st-level power_


**Casting Time** : 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 60 feet of you
falls
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : 1 minute
Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature’s rate of descent
slows to 60 feet per round until the power ends. If the creature lands before the power
ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the power ends for that
creature.

##### Surgerize

_7th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 minute
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 1 hour
You touch a creature and begin to perform surgery on it. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit
points. For the duration of the power, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each
of its turns (10 hit points each minute).

The target’s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored
after 2 minutes if you have the original to reattach it. Alternatively, if you have another
organ, limb, cybernetic, or other replacement, you can attach it during this over the
course of 1 minute.

##### Synaptic Static

_5th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You choose a point within range and cause a mind-melting frequency to explode there.
Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make an
Intelligence saving throw. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can’t be
affected by this power. A target takes 8d6 psionic damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.

After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls
a d6 and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well
as its Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. The target can make an
Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success.


#### T Powers

##### Tactical Barrier

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 bonus action
**Range** : 60 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
A shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of your choice within range,
granting it a +2 bonus to AC for the duration.

##### Teleport

_7th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 10 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
This power instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that
you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a
destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-
foot cube, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you
choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. In
order to teleport to a location, you must be familiar with it, and it must be less than a
sub-sector’s distance away.

##### Teleporter Gate

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 500 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create linked teleportation portals that remain open for the duration. Choose two
points on the ground that you can see, one point within 10 feet of you and one point
within 500 feet of you. A circular portal, 10 feet in diameter, opens over each point. If
the portal would open in the space occupied by a creature, the power fails, and the
casting is lost.

The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings, hovering inches from the ground and
perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is visible only from one side (your
choice), which is the side that functions as a portal.


Any creature or object entering the portal exits from the other portal as if the two were
adjacent to each other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side has no effect.
You can view from one side of the portal to the other. On your turn, you can rotate the
rings as a bonus action so that the active side faces in a different direction.

##### Time Ravage

_9th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 90 feet
**Duration** : Instantaneous
You target a creature you can see within range, putting its physical form through the
devastation of rapid aging. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking
10d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If
the save fails, the target also ages to the point where it has only 30 days left before it
dies of old age. In this aged state, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability
checks, and saving throws, and its walking speed is halved. Only the _weave reality_ power
or the _medicae major_ power cast as a 9th-level power can end these effects and restore
the target to its previous age.

##### Toxin Purge

_2nd-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 1 hour
You touch a creature. If it is poisoned or diseased, you neutralize the poison or
nonenhanced disease. If more than one poison or disease afflicts the target, you
neutralize one poison or nonenhanced disease that you know is present, or you
neutralize one at random.

For the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned or
diseased, and it has resistance to poison damage.

##### Tranquilizer

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 90 feet
**Duration** : 1 minute
You emit a tranquilizing dart that knocks a creature unconscious. Roll 5d8; if the
creature’s remaining hit points are less than the total, the creature falls unconscious
until the power ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or


slap the sleeper awake. This power has no effect on constructs or undead.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this powerat 2nd level or higher, you can target an
additional creature for each level above 1st. For each target, roll 5d8 separately.

##### Translation Program

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : 1 hour
For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you
hear, as long as the language is not a lost or unknown language. You also understand
any written language that you see, but you must be within reach of the surface on which
the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.

This power doesn’t decode secret messages in a text, nor does it interpret a glyph, such
as an ancient chaos rune, that isn’t part of a written language.

##### True Seeing

_6th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Touch
**Duration** : 1 hour
This power gives the willing creature you touch the ability to see things as they actually
are. For the duration, the creature has truesight, notices secret doors hidden by
illusions, and can see into the immaterium, all out to a range of 120 feet.

#### V Powers

##### Voltaic Shielding

_1st-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : Self
**Duration** : 1 hour
A protective barrier surrounds you, manifesting as crackling lightning that covers you
and your gear. You gain 5 temporary hit points for the duration. If a creature hits you
with a melee attack while you have these hit points, the creature takes 5 lightning
damage.


**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this power at 2nd level or higher, both the temporary
hit points and the lightning damage increase by 5 for each level.

#### W Powers

##### Weird

_9th-level power_
**Casting Time** : 1 action
**Range** : 120 feet
**Duration** : Concentration, up to 1 minute
You manifest a disruptive wave that discombobulates minds and sanity. Each creature in
a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make an
Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the
duration. At the end of each of the frightened creature’s turns, it must succeed on an
Intelligence saving throw or take 4d10 psionic damage. On a successful save, the power
ends for that creature.


# Appendix A: Conditions

## Conditions

Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of
a spell, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as
blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by
standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the
condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the
condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature
either has a condition or doesn’t.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a
condition.

## Blinded

```
⦁ A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that
requires sight.

abilities or magical effects.

hearing.

reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away
by the thunderwave spell.
```
#### Incapacitated

```
⦁ An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.
```
