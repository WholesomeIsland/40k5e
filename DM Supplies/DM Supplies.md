# Chapter 1: Variant Rules

## Powers

## Change Power Every Long Rest

Instead of swapping a power out at every level, you can instead do it at the end of every long
rest.

## Perils of the Warp

To represent the unwieldy dangers of psychic powers, the GM may call upon the psyker to roll to
see if a Peril of the Warp takes place. When casting a psychic power of 1st-level or higher, roll a
d20. On a result of a 1, a random psychic effect takes place, and the psyker rolls on the Perils of
the Warp table. The psychic effect takes place after the psychic power’s effects are resolved.

At the GM’s discretion, an effect can be chosen from the table instead of rolling for it, or a new
effect by the GM can occur.

**_GM Warning._** The game was not designed with this beinga rule used for standard play, and this
could cause party conflict, both in-character and out-of-character, or make psykers unfun to play
as and to play with due to their dangerous nature. Make sure everyone at your table thinks this is
a fine mechanic to play with before using it.

#### Perils of the Warp

```
d10 Effect
1 Frost. A burst of cold air emanates in a 15-foot radius,centered on you. Each creature
in that area takes 1d6 cold damage, and the area counts as difficult terrain until the start
of your next turn.
2 Blood Rain. It begins to rain blood for 1 minute.If you are indoors, the walls and
ceiling begin weeping blood.
3 Warp Aging. You immediately age 1d6 years.
4 Decay. An aura of decay emanates from you, spoilingall perishable foods within 30 feet
not behind full cover. Any plants in the area take 1d6 necrotic damage, as they begin to
wither.
5 Telepathic Screech. All creatures within 100 feetof you hear a telepathic scream of
creatures from the warp. Each creature that hears this must make a DC 10 Constitution
saving throw or become deafened until the end of your next turn.
6 One Question. You can ask a daemon or deity of yourchoice one question, and receive
```

```
a telepathic answer in the form of a cryptic omen or a vision. Whether you ask a
question or not, you take 2d6 psionic damage as you recoil from the experience.
7 Mass Invisibility. Each creature within 30 feet ofyou becomes invisible for 1 minute.
The invisibility ends on a creature when it attacks or casts a power.
8 Thrown Through the Warp. You are thrown into the warp,appearing in an unoccupied
space you can see within 30 feet of your choice. Upon reappearing, you take 2d
psionic damage as you reel from the horrific experiences. You do not take this damage
if you are immune to being frightened.
9 Uncontrollable Lightning. You and three creaturesof your choice within 30 feet of you
take 2d10 lightning damage.
10 Dark Summoning. A lesser daemon of the GM’s choiceis summoned in an unoccupied
space within 30 feet of the caster. This daemon is not compelled to act in any specific
way, and may become hostile upon being summoned.
```
### Psychic Recoil

To emphasize the conditions psykers find themselves in, whether it be all of the time or perhaps
only when in warp-susceptible areas, psionic damage is almost always imminent when using
their powers.

When casting a psychic power, the caster takes psionic damage equal to the power’s level. For
example, a sorcerer casting _fireball_ as a 3rd-levelpower will take 3 psionic damage. This
damage can’t be mitigated through resistance or immunity.

Additionally, the GM may want to add the following exception to represent sanctioned psykers,
such as librarians or astropaths, that are protected against the powers of the warp:

When taking damage from psychic recoil, the caster can instead choose to take no damage. The
caster can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + their psycasting modifier (to a
minimum of 1). The caster regains all uses of this feature at the end of a long rest.

At the GM’s discretion, this could also be applied to all casters to represent unwieldy technology,
dangerous xenotech, or to balance the playing field for all casters.

**_GM Warning._** The game was not designed with this beinga rule used for standard play, and this
could make psykers unfun to play as.

### Pushing Powers

Some GMs may want psykers or other types of casters to be able to push themselves beyond
their usual limits, at the cost of great stress.


If a caster chooses to, they can cast a power without using psyker points or tech points, or cast a
power at a higher level than they can normally. When casting a power without using psyker
points or tech points, the caster takes 2d12 psionic damage per power level. If the caster is
casting the power at a higher level, the caster takes 2d12 psionic damage for every level higher
they want to cast the power at. This damage is dealt after the power has been resolved, and can’t
be mitigated by resistance or immunity.

## Gameplay

### Mixed Parties: Including Space Marines

If you have a party consisting of space marines and non-space marines, you may want the
non-space marine characters to start with enhanced items, such as those found within Chapter
2.2: Space Marines. For a frame of reference, it is recommended that non-space marine
characters have at least one rare enhanced item, and two uncommon enhanced items when
beginning with a space marine in their party.

### Creature Types Revamped

All of the creature types in this supplement are represented as humanoids. For more diversity, the
GM may want some of the creature types for player characters and monsters. This can affect the
balancing of powers, such as _charm person_ and _holdperson_ only being able to target humanoids.

```
● Techfused : Construct
● Orks : Plant
● Space Marines, Primarchs : Giant
● Mutants : Monstrosity
● Tainted : Daemon
```
**_GM Warning._** This can drastically affect the balancingof your setting, as powers such as _charm
person_ and _hold person_ only work on humanoids, andcertain effects such as an exorcist’s witch
sight can detect daemons, which would include tainted.

### Background Feats

With this variant feature, every character gains an additional feat for free from their background.
The GM may put restrictions on what feats are available and must request that it is related
directly to your background. For example, a scholar would not be able to take the athlete feat
without proper justification from their story.


### More Proficiencies from Intelligence

During Character Creation, you gain an additional proficiency with a tool, tech gadget, musical
instrument, or language of your choice for every point your Intelligence modifier is over 0.

For example, a mechnician with 14 Intelligence has a +2 Intelligence modifier. This mechnician
gets to choose up to two additional proficiencies for a set of artisan’s tools, tech gadget, musical
instrument, a language, or a combination of those listed. He decides to choose a tech gadget, the
mechanic’s kit, and the language Binary.

### Encumbrance

The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for
more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment.
When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.

If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are **encumbered** , which means
your speed drops by 10 feet.

If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying
capacity, you are instead **heavily encumbered** , whichmeans your speed drops by 20 feet and
you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength,
Dexterity, or Constitution.

### Equipment Sizes

In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within
the bounds of common sense. For example, a burly ogryn won’t fit in a ratling’s armor, and a
watcher in the dark would be swallowed up in a space marine’s elegant robe.

The GM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of armor made for one human might not
fit another one without significant alterations, and a guard’s uniform might be visibly ill-fitting
when a character tries to wear it as a disguise.

Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be
worn, they might need to visit an armorsmith, tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert to make the
item wearable. The cost for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the
item. The DM can either roll 1d4 × 100 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent of
the alterations required.

### Ability Score: Influence

Influence is an ability score that can be used to represent a character’s ability to withhold a
reputation, whether it be fame or infamy, in certain situations. The Influence ability score can be


used to request aid, request or intimidate those of similar or higher standing to withdraw or
disobey orders, or to potentially purchase gear.

Influence begins at 10 when you first create a character, and it can go up or down depending on
what the character does throughout their journey. Unlike Honor, Influence is not a measure of
you keeping your word, or about your morality in certain situations. Instead, Influence is used as
a measure of how competent you are deemed, and how much of a threat or a boon you are to the
people around you. An arch-priest and a crime lord might have the same Influence score, for
example, but for different reasons.

**_Influence Checks._** At the GM’s discretion, you maybe called upon to perform an Influence
check. Requesting things like favors from a superior, ordering an unfamiliar or neutral faction to
perform a task, or simply attempting to haggle down goods are all indicators of what an
Influence check may be used for.

**_Influence saving throws._** At the GM’s discretion, youmay be called upon to perform an
Influence saving throw. This can occur if someone attempts to slander your name, if you’ve done
something that seems incompetent (such as assassinating the wrong target), or if you’ve been
caught in a compromising situation or a scandal with your station.

The GM might also allow you to substitute your Influence ability score in place of other skill
checks. For example, an inquisitor attempting to convince a planetary governor to send his
planetary defense force against a wave of oncoming tyranids might require an Intimidation
(Influence) skill check.

### No Alignments

Morality in _Warhammer 40k_ goes far beyond being good,evil, or siding with law or chaos. Some
GMs may opt out of alignment entirely, only using it as a sidenote when necessary if a mechanic
calls for it.

### Specific Ammunition Costs

A _bolt weapon_ isn’t going to use the same type ofammunition found within an assault rifle’s
magazine, nor is the cost going to be the same. With this rule, the cost of ammunition is based on
the rarity of the weapon, and when you purchase the ammunition, you need to specify what type
of weapon it is for, such as a _bolt weapon_ magazineor a _pulse weapon_ power cell.

The costs listed below are for the entire magazine of ammunition, not per projectile.

#### Ammunition Cost Table

```
Item Cost Weight
Common, standard equipment 10 g —
```

Uncommon 100 g —

Rare 500 g —

Very rare 1,000 g —

Legendary/Artifact 5,000 g —


# Chapter 2: Boons & Banes

Part 1: Acquiring a Boon

Part 2: Boons

Part 3: Banes

## Part 1: Acquiring a Boon or Bane

## Boons

A boon is a special reward granted by a being or force of great power, such as daemon, deity, or
another mystical force. Such supernatural gifts give a character an extraordinary ability, which
can be used one or more times.

A character might receive a boon by performing a monolithic accomplishment that attracts the
attention of otherworldly powers. Killing mundane hive gangers rarely warrants such a boon, but
slaying the hive tyrant of a tyranid fleet at a crucial point in battle might. A boon may be an
appropriate reward for any of the following accomplishments:

```
● Restoring a sacred shrine to a deity, or defiling a sacred shrine in the name of a deity.
● Stopping the raze and sacrifice of a world or many worlds, or sacrificing and razing a
world or many worlds.
● Aiding a god’s favored servant to complete a holy or unholy quest.
```
A character might also receive a boon in advance of a daunting challenge. Before the eve of a
battle, a space marine may fall to his knees in prayer, and receive a temporary boon for the battle
to come. Some boons may come with expectations or require a contract made with their
benefactor, such as agreeing to free a chaos lord’s master in exchange for greater strength.

A character retains the benefit of a boon forever, or until it is taken away by the creature that
granted it. Most people go their entire life without receiving even one of these boons. There is no
limit to the amount of boons a character can receive, but it should be rare for a character to have
more than one at a time, with notable exceptions, such as Abaddon the Despoiler. Moreover, a
character can’t receive multiple instances of the same blessing at a time. For example, a character
cannot benefit from two instances of Unliving Fortitude at once.

All boons are psychic effects, unless stated otherwise. Ultimately, distributing boons is up to the
GM, and therefore an entirely new system to distribute boons could be created, or boons may
simply not be present in the campaign.

Example boons are listed below. The text of a boon addresses its user.


## Part 2: Boons

### Types of Boons

Every boon has a deity or archetype associated with it. It is unusual for a follower of Khorne to
suddenly be granted immense psychic power, so the gods listed below mostly assign boons
related to their archetype or speciality.

Some gods, such as Slaanesh, could cover a very wide array of boons—for example, a man who
kills in the most extravagant ways, decorating himself with the skin of his enemies, could easily
fall to Slaanesh under the aspect of excess, rather than Khorne for violence and blood.

Furthermore, boons are listed in three tiers: minor, major, and godlike. These are assigned only
when large milestones are hit. As an example for Khorne, the conquering and subjugation of
local warlords on a feudal planet might reward several minor boons or one major boon, while
plunging an entire sector into war could grant a godlike boon.

Although certain boons are aligned with specific deities, Chaos Undivided is able to be taken by
any worshiper of Chaos. At the GM’s discretion, you may be awarded boons from another deity
that you are not specifically aligned to, if you embody that attribute enough. For example, a
Khornate that praises endurance in battle might be awarded a boon that increases his maximum
hit points.

## Part 3: Banes

All daemon pacts come with banes: disabilities that are aligned with your god. These can be
curses attributed to disobeying a daemon, or simply a side effect of the sheer amount of warp
taint an individual develops after being exposed to corruption for too long.

### Acquiring Banes

Almost every pact comes with a bane as a result of lingering warp taint that corrupts the flesh
and soul. Intentional or not, many of the banes that an individual receives can be viewed as an
extension of their dealings and allegiances, rather than the result of a curse.

On a rare occasion, a warp curse may be afflicted upon someone that has bested a daemon in a
duel, such as Primarch Sanguinius’s duel against Ka’Bandha, a bloodthirster of Khorne. These
curses are very powerful, and come at a moment of deep scorn for the daemon.

The GM can assign banes over the course of a campaign as they see fit. As a rule of thumb, a
major boon would be accompanied by a minor bane, and a godlike boon would be accompanied
by a major bane.

Banes from Chaos Undivided can be distributed to any member of the other four Ruinous
Powers (Khorne, Nurgle, Slaanesh, Tzeentch). Banes are not always meant to punish characters,
but are rather the side effects of the warp manifesting itself in various, distorted ways.


### Removing Banes

Removing banes are possible, but often require extensive measures to prevent resurfacing, as
they are typically warp curses that prevail through any sense of common logic.

**Minor banes** debase the superficial body of an individual.Minor banes can be removed through
the use of extensive surgery over a period of months to prevent regrowths, a _remove curse_ power
of 4th level or higher, or other measures, such as always wearing purity seals, attending convents
and undergoing purification rituals, and soul binding yourself to another deity.

**Major banes** are much stronger, and leave noticeablestains on one’s mind and body. These
banes require much more rigorous methods to cleanse. A _remove curse_ power of 7th-level or
higher removes the bane entirely, and months to years of meditation, training, purification is
required to fully cleanse oneself of a major bane. Cybernetics and surgery cannot cleanse these
banes, as they are beyond metal and flesh, and are the product of vengeance, ire, and disdain
manifest.

**Condemning banes** defile the mind, body, and soul.These are rarely given, and are reserved
only for the greatest foes a deity may face. Notable condemning banes include the Blood Angel’s
eternal curse of the Red Thirst, the fate of Horus’s shattered soul, or simply becoming a chaos
spawn.

## Making Your Own Boons & Banes

I created this document with a formula in mind. If you decide to create your own boons and
banes, here are the general guidelines I used to create them.

As a blanket statement, I tried to eliminate statements or phrases that are not outside of game
mechanics, such as “you must vanquish a weakened enemy at any cost.” Rather, I tried putting
boons and banes into mechanics that already exist, such as “you cannot willingly choose to
knock someone unconscious.” This allows room for counterplay as a player, such as allowing
that player to attack other targets, or his allies to engage essential targets instead with the
intention of capture.


If there are instances where a player is forced to roleplay in a certain direction, such as “you
cannot tell a deliberate lie,” I instead opted to put these banes behind Wisdom saving throws, to
give players the ability to resist. Otherwise, it could feel like the player has lost their sense of
agency to be able to make decisions.

I have attempted to make boons more situational, and allow more utilities to the player, rather
than flat increases in strength, with the exception of the Ability Score Improvements available,
because those are idealistic of the gods in question.

I did not enjoy how other games put mutations on a chart, and listed them from 1 to 100, with 1
being flavorful effects with no real penalty, and 100 being almost as bad as death. Instead, I
separated the boons and banes into categories, with each tier having specific guidelines to their
benefits and penalties, rather than getting (un)lucky on a roll for a d100 table and letting that
decide if your character is going to become unplayable or not.

### Boon Creation

#### Godlike Boons

These are ultimately powerful effects, resembling that of 17th- and 20th-level characters. These
mimic the cornerstone features of classes or single effects from artifacts. A 9th-level power once
per day, immense increase in damage, or the ability to cast powers with greater ease are all
representative of godlike boons.

Truly powerful abilities should be limited to once per short or long rest, such as reducing all
damage taken to 0 for one attack.

These can also take the form of abilities so powerful, the character can only use them once
before expending all of its power. Such examples include the ability to summon a greater
daemon to their location once, or destroying a planet.

#### Major Boons

Boons that grant a frequently-used or situationally powerful ability. Powers of 3rd- or 4th-level
that can be cast once per long rest can make good situational rewards, and can align with a
deity’s intentions well.

Major boons are generally impactful once per long rest abilities, or helpful well-rounded
abilities, but they should not be the character’s identity.

#### Minor Boons

A minor boon takes the form of a small blessing that is mostly to display the alignment of a
character, rather than something to truly reward someone for duty. At-will powers, languages,
skill or tool proficiencies, and common enhanced items can all be minor boons.


Alternatively, casting a 1st-level power once per short or long rest suffices for more situational
boons. In some circumstances, casting a 2nd-level power once per long rest can also make for an
apt reward.

### Bane Creation

#### Condemning Banes

Condemning banes are true curses. These are typically not used to inflict absolute death, but
rather suffering reflective of a deity inflicting some form of damnation upon a creature. Try not
to make condemning banes that hinder the character at every corner, such as disadvantage on all
attack rolls or a permanent poisoned condition. Although true to the lore and representative of a
true daemon’s power, it cripples a character, resulting in an unfun play environment for that
player.

Condemning banes should be felt on a day-by-day basis for the character in question. An
optimized condemning bane should not remove features or boons, but instead impose penalties in
more frequent circumstances.

Some of the more interesting condemning banes may be twofold. For example, a curse of
Khorne could prevent a character from engaging in melee combat unless that character shouts
“Blood for the Blood God!” before attacking.

#### Major Banes

Major banes are harmful effects, but are not debilitating. These affect situations that the character
might find themselves in several times during a campaign, such as when in harsh negotiations or
when dealing with a psyker.

Penalties to specific skill checks, saving throws for a specific ability score, or to a specific type
of power (tech or psychic) are good blanket examples of what a major bane might encompass. It
is something that may not appear every session, but it still provides a detriment when it is
encountered.

Take note that some banes, such as disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws, are going to be far
more effective than others, such as disadvantage on Charisma saving throws, due to the
prevalence and frequency of Wisdom saving throws throughout the system.

#### Minor Banes

Minor banes take the form of flavorful effects to add good roleplaying potential. Being marked
by Chaos, whether it be through minor mutations or an aura that you exude, are good examples
of what a minor bane can encompass.


I tried for minor banes to _not_ have positive effects. These are strictly negative, but can be
roleplayed into for greater appeal.

## Objects

## Siege Equipment

Siege weapons are designed to assail fortresses, vehicles, and other walled fortifications. They
see much use in campaigns that feature war. Most siege weapons don’t move around a battlefield
on their own; they require creatures or vehicles to move them, as well as to load, aim, and fire
them.

#### Heavy Weapon

These personal heavy weapons usually take the form of lascannons or autocannons and can be
mounted on top of vehicles or placements. Lascannons deal energy damage, shuriken cannons
and autocannons deal kinetic damage, and plasma cannons deal acid damage. They typically
only take one person to man effectively.

_Large object_
**Armor Class:** 15
**Hit Points:** 50
**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic
A personal heavy weapon is a cannon that shoots projectiles that can deal massive damage to
placements, barricades, or vehicles. Before it fires, it must be loaded. It takes one action to load,
and one action to fire it. This is an enhanced weapon.
**_Las Barrage._** _Ranged Weapon_ Attack: +6 to hit, range120/480 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 16
(3d10) energy damage.


#### Artillery Cannon

Artillery takes the form of mounted howitzers, mortars placements, and surface-to-air flak
cannons.

_Huge object_
**Armor Class** : 15
**Hit Points:** 150
**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic
Artillery cannons throw their payloads in a high arc so it can hit targets behind cover. Before an
artillery cannon can be fired, it must be loaded and aimed. It takes two actions to load the
weapon, two actions to aim it, and one action to fire it.
Artillery typically fires explosive shells. However, it can also launch other kinds of
projectiles, such as poisonous gas or high-explosive ammunition, with different effects.

**_Mortar Round._** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, range300/1,200 ft. (can’t hit targets
within 60 feet of it). every creature within 5 feet of target. _Hit:_ 22 (4d10) fire damage and 22
(4d10) kinetic damage.

## Part 4: Vehicles

### Civilian Vehicles

These vehicles are not intended for combat use, but may be found in adventures for faster

transportation or in the heat of a getaway.

#### Bicycle

A bicycle, also known as a two-wheeled locomized self-propelling device (or TWLSPD),
consists of a metal frame, two wheels connected by a chain, and a set of pedals connected to the
chain in order to propel oneself at a higher rate of speed than walking. Some bicycles come with
multiple seats used for multiple riders.

_Medium object_
**Armor Class:** 10
**Hit Points:** 10
**Speed:** 40 ft.
**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic
**Damage Vulnerabilities:** acid

**_Occupancy._** Bicycles can seat up to 2 Medium creaturescomfortably.


#### Civilian Car

_Large object_

**Armor Class** : 14

**Hit Points:** 70

**Speed:** 80 ft.

**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic

**Damage Vulnerabilities:** acid, lightning

**_Occupancy._** The civilian car can seat up to 4 Mediumcreatures comfortably.

**_Explosive._** If the car is destroyed using fire damageor a weapon that ignites objects, it explodes.

Creatures within 10 feet of the vehicle can make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16

(3d10) fire damage on a failure, and half as much on a success.

#### Civilian Van

Used in urban areas, these vehicles are used for families or rented for groups of people.

_Huge object_

**Armor Class:** 13

**Hit Points:** 90

**Speed:** 70 ft.

**Damage Immunities:** psychic, poison

**Damage Vulnerabilities:** acid, lightning

Creatures within 10 feet of the vehicle can make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16

(3d10) fire damage on a failure, and half as much on a success.

#### Civilian Bus

_Gargantuan object_

**Armor Class:** 12

**Hit Points:** 125

**Speed:** 60 ft.

**Damage Immunities:** psychic, poison

**Damage Vulnerabilities:** acid, lightning


**_Occupancy._** The civilian bus can seat up to 24 Mediumcreatures comfortably.

**_Explosive._** If the car is destroyed using fire damageor a weapon that ignites objects, it explodes.

Creatures within 10 feet of the vehicle can make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16

(3d10) fire damage on a failure, and half as much on a success.


# Chapter 4: Enhanced Items

The ability to plunder enhanced items from defeated enemies or discovering long-long
archaeotech from lost cities is an experience players expect. Such items grant capabilities a
character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement ehir owner’s capabilities in new
ways.

Attunement

Enhanced Items List

## Rarity

Each enhanced item has a rarity: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, legendary, and artifact.
Common enhanced items, such as the _medpac_ , are themost plentiful. Some legendary items,
such as an _alpha core_ , might only be one of the fewleft in existence. The secrets used to create
the most powerful and advanced technology have been lost to history as a result of wars and
time. Even uncommon items can’t be easily created. Thus, many enhanced items are unique and
well-preserved relics.

Rarity provides a rough measure of an item’s power relative to other enhanced items. Each rarity
corresponds to a character level, as shown below in the Enhanced Item Rarity and Identification
table. A character doesn’t typically find a prototype enhanced item, for instance, until 5th-level
or later. That said, rarity shouldn’t get in the way of your campaign’s story. If you want a piece of
archaeotech to fall into the hands of 1st-level characters, so be it. No doubt a great story will
arise from that event.

#### Enhanced Item Rarity and Prices

```
Rarity Character Level Value Identification DC
Common 1st or higher 500-1,000 g 5
Uncommon 1st or higher 1,001-5,000 g 10
```
```
Rare 5th or higher 5,001-50,000 g 15
Very Rare 11th or higher 50,001-500,000 g 20
Legendary 17th or higher 500,001+ g 25
```
If your campaign allows for trade in enhanced items, rarity can also help you set prices for them.
As the GM, you determine the value of an individual enhanced item based on its rarity.
Suggested values are provided in the Enhanced Item Rarity table. The value of a consumable,
such as a dose of a drug or a medpac, is typically half the value of a permanent item of the same
rarity.


### Identifying Enhanced Items

Some enhanced items have properties not readily distinguishable to the naked eye. Identifying
such an item requires use of the _analyze_ tech power.

If a player is proficient in the appropriate type of tools and have the tools with them, they can
make a check to identify the properties of an enhanced item over the course of a short rest. The
DM ultimately determines if the tools are appropriate or not. To use this benefit, the enhanced
item must be within reach.

#### Variant: Simpler Identification

If you prefer enhanced items to be more readily identifiable, you can allow characters to identify
enhanced items through experimentation. Over the course of a short rest, a character can focus
on one enhanced item while being in physical contact with it. At the end of the short rest, the
character learns the item’s properties, as well as how to use them.

### Attunement

Some enhanced items require a creature to form a bond with them before their enhanced
properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for
it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item.

Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its
nonenhanced benefits. For example, an enhanced shield that requires attunement provides the
benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its enhanced properties.

Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend an uninterrupted short rest focused on only that
item while being in physical contact with it. This focus can take the form of weapon practice,
praying to the machine spirits, meditation, or some other appropriate activity. At the end of the
short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any enhanced
properties of the item, including any necessary command words or activation phrases.

An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to a
maximum of three items at a time; any attempt to attune to an additional item fails.

A creature’s attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for
attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature
dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by
spending another short rest with the item, unless the item is cursed or is a piece of dangerous
technology.

### Cursed Items

Some enhanced items bear curses that bedevil their users, sometimes long after a user has
stopped using an item. An enhanced item’s description specifies whether the item is cursed. Most
methods of identifying items, such as the _analyze_ tech power, fail to reveal such a curse,


although lore might hint at it. A curse should be a surprise to the item’s user when the curse’s
effects are revealed.

Attunement to a cursed item can’t be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first.

### Dangerous Technology

Some enhanced items are a product of dangerous and archaic technology. An enhanced item’s
description specifies whether the item is dangerous technology or not. Methods of identifying
dangerous technology, such as the _analyze_ power, candetect most forms of faulty mechanisms,
such as a _plasma weapon_ having a chance to overheat.

Some items that are dangerous technology, such as _butcher’s nails_ , are extremely dangerous to
unattune to or remove once implanted, and detail in their description how to remove or unattune
to these items.

### Enhanced Item Categories

Enhanced items fall into different categories depending on the type of enhanced item. Some
categories, such as weapons and armor, are obvious. Others are less so.

#### Adventuring Gear

Items that don’t fall in one of the other categories are considered adventuring gear. They might
be worn items, such as boots or a jetpack, or hand-held item like a unique data slate. This
category is a catch-all for items that don’t fit in other categories.

#### Armor

Unless an armor’s description says otherwise, armor must be worn for its enhanced properties to
function.

Some suits of enhanced armor specify the type of armor they are, such as mesh armor or power
armor, or the category in which they fall, such as light or heavy armor. If an enhanced armor
doesn’t specify its armor type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.

#### Consumables

Typically, consumables are single use (unless the description says otherwise). Once a
consumable is used, it takes effect immediately and is rendered useless.

The value of consumables, due to their impermanent nature, is typically half that of permanent
enhanced items. Consumables are sub-categorized by their type:
**_Drugs._** Drugs are designed to give short-term effectsto a creature, like increased speed, or
extra strength. Drugs can last anywhere from up to a minute to several hours.


**_Ammunition._** Ammunition includes special designs of ammunition patterns, such as unique
bolt ammunition, or ammunition that has been modified to have special properties. Ammunition
typically comes in a full magazine or fully-charged power cell, unless specified otherwise.
**_Explosives._** Explosives, such as a _krak grenade_ , aredesigned to cause an effect in a radius
that varies depending on their nature.
**_Poisons._** Poisons are used to incapacitate or harmbeasts and humanoids.
**_Medication._** Medications can be used to restore hitpoints, cure conditions, or otherwise heal
or strengthen a creature. Medications do not work on constructs or undead, unless specified
otherwise.
**_Technology._** Technology consumables are used to enhanceinteractions with technology and
other uses, including repairing constructs and vehicles.

#### Cybernetic Augmentations

Cybernetic augmentations are enhancements built into biological creatures, such as beasts or
humanoids. They come in the form of replacements, which replace a physical body part, or
enhancements, which simply augment a creature. Cybernetic augmentations are discussed further
later in this chapter.

#### Focuses

Focuses are sub-categorized depending on what type of casting they augment: psychic or tech.

**_Psychic._** Psychic focuses are used to augment the castingof psychic powers. The most common
type of psychic focuses are tribalistic totems, symbols of the aquila (holy symbols), chaos stars
(unholy symbols), and other items that can redirect their psychic energies.

**_Tech._** Tech focuses are used to augment the castingof tech powers. The most common type of
tech focuses are data slates and wrist pads, which can be worn on the forearm of the techcaster.

#### Shields

Like armor, unless the description says otherwise, the shield must be actively wielded for its
enhanced properties to function.

#### Weapons

Whether crafted for a nefarious or benevolent purpose, weapons are among the most coveted of
enhanced items.

Some enhanced items specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a
longsword or assault rifle, or the category in which they fall, such as swords or ranged weapons.
If an enhanced weapon doesn’t specify its weapon type, you may choose the type or determine it
randomly.


### Cybernetic Augmentations

Some characters are dissatisfied with their inborn gifts, while some are simply looking to
augment their natural prowess. The less fortunate, however, might find themselves missing a
limb. For all of these characters, cybernetic augmentations suit a purpose.

**_Installing Cybernetics._** Installing a cybernetic requiresthe cybernetic that you want to install, a
willing or incapacitated creature, and a set of chirurgeon’s tools. The creature installing the
cybernetic must have proficiency with chirurgeon’s tools, the Medicine skill, or the Tech skill.
At the GM’s discretion, another set of tools and proficiencies may be able to install the
cybernetic, such as a mechanic’s kit to install a cybernetic arm. Some cybernetics have unique
rules for installation listed in their description, which you will use instead of these rules.

**_Attunement._** Some cybernetics require attunement. Ifthat is the case, they follow all of the same
rules for attunement as usual. If you become unattuned to a cybernetic while it is still implanted,
you lose the benefits of that cybernetic.

**_Installation Targets & Time._** Typically, only beastsand humanoids can use cybernetics. It takes
1 hour to install a cybernetic in a creature size Medium or smaller, and the time doubles for each
size above Medium.

**_Cost._** The standard rate to install cybernetics costs100 gelt per cybernetic, if performed by an
NPC.

**_Removing Cybernetics._** Removing a cybernetic takeshalf the time and gelt it would to install.
Additionally, if removing a replacement cybernetic, the recipient loses the ability to use the
missing part until it receives another suitable replacement.
